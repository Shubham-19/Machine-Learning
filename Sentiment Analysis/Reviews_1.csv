18666,50158511,10-10-2015,1559265,Jody,Very nice flat. We had easy transportation to everywhere via the Metro. We could see Sagrada Familia from the terrace. Our hosts helped us with questions we had. Thanks!
18674,4808211,27-05-2013,4841196,Caron,"Great location. Clean, spacious flat. Would recommend to anyone."
18674,10660311,02-03-2014,11600277,Juan Carlos,"Mi mejor recomendación para este departamento. Cuida todos los detalles, adicionalmente muy cómodo, limpio, funcional y situado perfectamente. "
18674,41087522,04-08-2015,35231385,Shlomi,"Big apartment, well equipped.
Very good service, excellent location.
Recommended."
18674,81000756,20-06-2016,23223644,Joost,"The Check in was fast and flexible. The price is fair, because the flat ist big enough for 8 people if you are flexible as well. We were the in a time where it wasn't so hot outside, so I have no idea how hot it can get inside. This was my second Airbnb stay so I can't compare it so good with other apartments but I would wish me, that the owner, offers the guests more toilet paper  etc. . Because if it is a short stay, you don't want to buy all the staff in big packages. 


All in all we are very happy with this decision "
18674,278588962,18-06-2018,4756672,Marius,"Great location and enough space in the apartment for 7 people. Although the mattresses were a bit too soft and the house is quite noisy, its a solid choice for a big group of people for a weekend in barcelona."
18674,408388148,04-02-2019,118847863,Sonora,"Our experience here was mixed. 
The location of this flat is super close to La Sagrada Familia, and there are lots of cute restaurants and cafes nearby. 

The flat itself wad impersonal and not well represented by the photos. The folks who rent this spot have a bunch of other places in the city. So even though it was spacious, it lacked charm, and was heavily used without being heavily cleaned.

There were extra pillows, but no extra pillow cases; the one spare blanket was covered in unwashed food stains (as was the furniture); and while the large bed was comfy, the small bed I slept in felt like laying on a box filled with metal springs. 

I have an Airbnb if my own, and work very hard to accurately represent my space. It was disappointing not to find that to be the case here.

That said, check-in was easy, and when we had trouble with the heater, the response was quick."
23197,199839,15-03-2011,409630,Tim,"We (5 friends) were staying for a conference in the nearby center and were pleasantly surprised. The apartment was clean, quiet, modern and spacious. It had extensive commodities like laundry machines, fast internet, dish washer and a nice balcony.
I would definitely recommend it!"
23197,857673,11-01-2012,1594062,Aaron,The host canceled my reservation 138 days before arrival.
23197,40030652,27-07-2015,4933115,Thomas,We had a nice stay at the apartment. It is a 10 min walk to the beach and a 5 minute walk to a huge shopping center. The apartment is spacious and has a well equipped kitchen. We would stay there again. 
23197,48679422,28-09-2015,154018,Addison,"Great apartment! It was plenty spacious for us, and the balcony is just great. Tony was super helpful getting me oriented and giving us tips for our stay. We were going to a conference at CCIB, which is just down the street. Getting into the center was also very easy since we had a tram stop right in front of the building and a metro stop a short walk away. We would definitely stay there again in a heartbeat!"
23197,50292863,11-10-2015,11726135,Wallace,"I stayed in Marnie's apartment with two colleagues while attending a conference at the CCIB Centre in Barcelona. The apartment is lovely and very convenient to the Convention Centre. It's also a short walk to a shopping centre that has a supermarket. The apartment was very clean and well appointed. We felt very at home and there were even some Spanish beers left for us in the fridge.

I would be very pleased to stay again."
23197,58913119,05-01-2016,50658453,Alix,"L appartement est spacieux chaleureux, calme et bien équipé . Attention il est situé à Badalona assez loin du centre de Barcelone contrairement au posionnement annoncé sur la carte. Comptez 12 à 20 euros de taxi pour rejoindre le centre. La place plus la place de parking en sous sol n est pas non plus comprise dans le prix ce qui est un peu mesquin à  mon goût vu les tarifs pratiques mais on s est quand même bien amusés."
23197,63802917,27-02-2016,29124245,Daniel,"The apartment was great! Convenient location, really clean, and there was even a bottle of wine waiting for us!"
23197,73435617,08-05-2016,60518621,Travis,"The Forum Deluxe apartment hosted by Etain was excellent, overall.

A group of 4 colleagues stayed in this apartment during our business trip to the Barcelona CCIB conference center and were very pleased with our stay.

Pros:
- very close (5 min walk) to the CCIB conference/convention center and beach
- very clean and well-equipped, modern apartment which has been accurately advertised by the host
- local area felt safe
- 4 physical beds for 4 individual sleeping arrangements (2 double options available for a total of 6 bed spaces)--as advertised
- We were able to reserve the entire apartment with only 4 guests

Suggested improvements:
- we experienced some timing/coordination inconvenience due to having only 2 apartment keys. This could easily be resolved if the host can provide 1 key/guest as-needed, especially for business travelers. Note: the apartment host (Etain) has been excellent and we expect this accommodation will be made.
- we were not initially aware of an additional, cash-only fee (""tourist tax"") which was requested during check-in. Rate was .72 x person x night and was rounded up to nearest Euro. E.g., total for our 4 person, 5 night stay was 15 Euro.
"
23197,86089088,14-07-2016,61965582,Annichen,"Great apartment, wounderful host and nice safe area. A bit further outside city center than we thought but easy to catch tram or metro. We might come again "
23197,87576557,20-07-2016,70806092,Tim,The apartment was absolutely beautiful! Perfect for our family. It was close to the metro and an easy walk to Diagonal Mar mall and lots of restaurants. Communication with our host was very helpful before and during our stay. We highly recommend this apartment for an awesome stay in Barcelona!
23197,93939986,14-08-2016,72514078,Flora,"Litt vanskelig å finne stedet, og drosjesjåføren slet litt, men vi ble møtt. Leiligheten var som den ble beskrevet, og alt fungerte fint. Fin terasse, men det er  noe bråk fra veien (selv om det ikke er den mest trafikerte veien i byen). Vi fikk frastjålet en sykkel fra gaten. Stod låst, men var borte på 10 minutter. Det skjer overalt i Barcelona, og var en påmindelse om at man bør passe på spesielt i Metro osv. 
Ellers går trikken rett utenfor leiligheten og det er lett å komme seg til byen eller standen. "
23197,98968732,02-09-2016,27763084,Nigel,"We had a wonderful 8 day stay at this apartment. We were attending a convention at the CCIB which is ~700m away  (an easy stroll) and we had a 5y old with us. 

We liked:
a) presence of a supermarket and a mall 700m away
b) easy tram access (50m away) & metro access (650m away) at El Maresme/Forum stop
c) lots of food around the metro stop and at the mall
d) very clean , well-kept apartment with all modern conveniences, great layout with a lovely balcony to sit in. The memory foam pillows in the master bedroom were a plus!
e) cool sea breeze throughout the day blowing thru the apartment, which was good for hot summers
f) Etain was also very responsive, and although she was away while we were in Barcelona, another person was there to help us settle in, and also to check out.

Overall, a very comfortable stay, in a lovely modern apartment. Two thumbs up!"
23197,110841659,28-10-2016,69414118,Andrius,Fantastic experience! Very easy to get to! Very close to the L4 Metro from Fórum to get into the city. Get the T-10 ticket if you plan to take the metro more than a few times. The apartments was fantastic! I was in town for 2 weeks and did a load of laundry and having a dryer was a rarity in the area. Everyone was friendly and welcoming. The entire experience was 5-stars!
23197,124554547,02-01-2017,16921190,Gabriel,"Good place, 

Excellent host.

I'll book it again next time I'll go to Barcelona"
23197,134974650,02-03-2017,52569384,Sema,"Great apartment, very clean and lots of space."
23197,143913329,14-04-2017,61010096,Samanta,"The place was as described and more. They accommodate out check in time. We were received by Tony who was wonderful. He gave us tips of places to go during our stay. Also, we had cold beverages waiting for us which it was a nice touch. The place was perfect. We were located at a first floor and with a beautiful balcony. In overall, I recommend this place to anyone who visits Barcelona. "
23197,150631225,08-05-2017,89754617,Alice,"Etain was an excellent host. Great communication from the start. The apartment is a beautiful, clean and spacious. The location was perfect for us, not in the hustle and bustle of the city and just a short public transport journey in. There is a tram stop just outside the door of the apartment. I can't recommend this apartment enough. Thankyou Etain for making our stay in Barcelona amazing! We will definitely be back. "
23197,154362623,24-05-2017,23537225,Cecilia,The place looks exactly as pictures. It is quite and even though is not centrally located public transportation and a complete shopping mall is 5 minutes away on foot . It was easy to communicate with the host and she was very helpful . 
23197,156578075,31-05-2017,90773973,Lauren,"We had a great week at Etain's place. This apartment is the perfect spot to stay if you are attending a function at the ICC. It was walking distance from the conference venue and right across the road from public transport, which made it really easy to get anywhere in Barcelona. There is a big shopping mall just down the road- very convenient."
23197,164834566,29-06-2017,137641361,Martin,The host canceled this reservation 335 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
23197,166983841,05-07-2017,656553,Rene,"This place is perfect for 3-4 people. It is located on outskirts of BCN near the beaches, and central to public transport. There is a large mall nearby that has anything you may need. All in all a solid place for a very reasonable price!"
23197,172816547,22-07-2017,3472883,Emily,"Well located airbnb right next to the tram and perfect for those attending a conference at the CCIB. Recommend Sabor Mudejar as a nice neighborhood tapas place.

Note to future guests: the AC is now only in the living room and while there are fans in all the bedrooms it was pretty warm in July and even with the door open and fan in the hall way to try to blow in some cool air it was a little toasty some nights. 

Would absolutely stay again but maybe not in July."
23197,183421661,17-08-2017,127721196,Joanne,"Lovely apartment in a quiet residential area. Easy access to the main Barcelona attractions via the nearby Metro station or the tram, which stops right outside the apartment. Just a 10 minute walk to a large shopping centre, which contains a supermarket, retail shops and restaurants. We preferred to eat at the local bars, which we found good value and decent quality. All in all we had a great stay and we would definitely recommend this apartment."
23197,197359439,25-09-2017,36204102,Robert,Wonderful apartment -  easy metro access to downtown.
23197,200448257,05-10-2017,151833917,Jose Luis,"El apartamento es tal como se describe. Muy cómodo, con una gran terraza, todo el menaje necesario  y muy limpio. Tony nos recibió a la llegada muy atentamente explicándonos varios temas sobre comunicaciones, lugares de interés, etc. Tanto Etain como Tony nos han atendido en todo momento fantásticamente, ayudándonos en cualquier necesidad. Sin duda a nuestra vuelta a Barcelona intentaremos reservar en este mismo lugar situado fuera del bullicioso centro, muy bien comunicado y en zona muy, muy segura."
23197,248778802,01-04-2018,86452262,Csaba,"Marnie's place is a clean, spacious, cozy and well located apartment in Barcelona. It is far from the noisy streets, close to a port and beaches. As we have been traveling to the northern area of Spain each day the location fitted for us perfectly. Marnie has been always very communicative, helpful and lovely with us. The arrival went smoothly, we haven't got any bad surprises. Thank you, Marnie again! :-)"
23197,269233152,27-05-2018,29476632,Pbrenner46,"The photos do not do justice to Etain’s apartment, which is spacious, bright, and comfortable. The beds are excellent, the furniture is very good, and the apartment features high quality appliances, a plentiful supply of dishes, silverware and cooking utensils, good wi-fi, and a lovely balcony. The location is great if you are attending an event at the Forum (about an 8-minute walk from the apartment) or want to be near the water. It was also quite good for exploring Barcelona, because the T4 tram stops 30 meters from the front door of the building and connects you easily to the L4 subway line. The nearest subway station is about a 10-minute walk. There are small food markets nearby, and a super large supermarket in the Diagonal Mall, about a 12 minute walk. (But it is easy enough to hop on the tram at the Mall and go two stops to the apartment.) My group consisted of 4 adults, three of whom stayed in the apartment for a very pleasant week. We would do so again the next time we are in Barcelona."
23197,277908334,17-06-2018,166538847,Andrew,Lovely apartment close by to everything 
23197,286862435,07-07-2018,7470721,Aditya,Etain's apartment is large spacious and exactly as mentioned in the listing. It is 5 mins from the convention centre so perfect for anyone who is in town for a congress. I would highly recommend staying here. 
23197,289882160,13-07-2018,67337908,Vittorio,Excellent solution when attending conferences in the nearby Centre Convencions Internacional Barcelona.

23197,334812300,10-10-2018,167671739,Raymond,Highly recommend! Just the right distance from all the hustle and bustle. Tram stop is 100 feet from the front door and provides easy access into the heart of the city within 10 minutes. The apartment is clean and well maintained.  Lots of space to entertain in living and dining area and the added benefit of a spacious balcony.
23197,336214681,14-10-2018,93208215,Emmanuel,"Great place and great host.  Very responsive and helpful.  Place is very spacious and located across the street from a tram stop.  If you learn the very useful and easy metro/tram/bus combo to get around Barcelona, you can get anywhere from this location."
23197,365455559,01-01-2019,220992441,Rafael,"El departamento cuenta con todo lo necesario para  6 personas.
La ubicación es excelente, tal cómo se menciona. El transporte público,  una maravilla a la puerta.  Fueron muy gentiles con un early check in y un late check out sin costo.  Pasamos una semana inolvidable en familia. Para mejorar, la cama matrimonial. Volveré a Barcelona, sin duda alguna. Rafael, Santiago de Chile"
25786,77146,11-08-2010,191524,Sammy And Dina,"Pedro is an intelligent, sensitive and kind young catalan. A cool cat, one might say. He reached out to us when we were really in a bind and invited us into his home despite the last minute request and the late hour. His apartment is clean, warm and friendly with a state of the art bathroom facility. Great guy that I highly recommend! "
25786,89965,04-09-2010,169957,Krishna,"I had a REALLY GREAT time with Pedro! He is extremely nice and his apartment is beautiful. I had a very comfortable room for myself, and Pedro generously let me use his kitchen. The location is just perfect - it is in the very central location and very close to 3 subway stations. I absolutely loved my stay in Barcelona. I would definitely recommend staying with Pedro!"
25786,102942,22-09-2010,218749,Molly & Charlie,Pedro's place is very comfortable and has all the essentials you need to travel.  He made sure we were comfortable and the location is convenient for the metro and is very active.  It is close to many restaurants and internet cafes and is within walking distance to the major Barcelona attractions.  Given all the wonderful activities within the area the noise level was a bit much for the light sleeper but we would highly recommned this place. 
25786,230882,18-04-2011,499814,Raphaël,"Pedro was very welcoming and nice, his flat is sunny and wonderfully situated, I strongly recommend him !"
25786,251270,04-05-2011,220142,Antonia,Friendly and inviting home. Conveniently located to the 5th Avenue shops and metro. I will definitely stay at Pedro's house again as he is a wonderful host.

Pedro is a warm host and interesting to talk to.  He is very flexible with the arrangements.  There are some bars right below but I think the noise is not any worse than most places in Barcelona.  The area has lots of nice shops and restaurants and it is also convenient to the central tourist spots.  "

25786,349252,03-07-2011,528643,Vincent,We were very happy of our stay at Pedro's place. Pedro had a real concern for our well being. The flat is clean and functional and very central in barcelona. The metro Diagonal is situated at 5min by foot. Pedro is a great host and is a great person.

25786,444780,14-08-2011,151007,Naty,"Pedro  es una magnifica persona y muy buen anfitrion. El lugar es para destacar ya que esta situado en el barrio Gracia, lugar tipico de Barcelona en donde las personas son del lugar y no turistas.
Muchas gracias Pedro por todo."
25786,500135,04-09-2011,414809,A. Patricia,"Pedro is really easy-going and nice. He helped me get all of my suitcases up the stairs since there was no elevator in the building. He also gave me some good advice for getting around and for living in Spain generally speaking. Also, the area is great. He is in the heart of Gracia so close to a lot of fun shops, cafes, and public transportation. The only thing is that the neighborhood can be a little noisy at night. Also, there is in an internet cafe around the corner since there is no internet in the apartment itself. "
25786,1119474,12-04-2012,384120,Laura,"We really enjoyed our time in BCN and at Pedro's. His flat is simple, pleasant, comfortable, and clean. And he is lovely-- very relaxed and welcoming. We instantly felt comfortable and really enjoyed our chats with him. He made some great recommendations for food in his neighborhood. We loved Gracia as well-- perfect place to explore this lovely city. "

25786,1507105,18-06-2012,2438818,Anki,"We had a very nice, but short stay in Barcelona. We enjoyed very much to meet Pedro, and got an instant liking to him. Friendly, open, sincere...
The flat has a great location in a more bohemian area of the city. Pedro couldn't be there when we arrived, but arranged very smoothly for someone to come and open up for us. Communication was quick and clear. "
25786,1519898,19-06-2012,704098,Dennison,"Pedro's place is in a super location, really pleasant and enjoyable. Tranquil with a lovely square downstairs- plenty of great restaurants and bars. A comfortable bed and a lovely little balcony overlooking the street.  I recommend! "

25786,1658317,08-07-2012,140458,Marie-Anne,I had a really good time staying at Pedro's! I learnt a lot from our interesting conversations - thanks Pedro! The apartment is well located and clean. Pedro is very respectful and accommodating. I would definitely recommend!
25786,1975782,13-08-2012,2653558,Kevin,"Stayed for 3 nights (Thu, Fri & Sat) and left very pleased with both the room and the host.

The room is on a somewhat quiet, tiny little road located within 5 minutes walk from Fontana and Diagonal subway stations (both on the L3 green line), although you can easily walk through Passeig de Gràcia right to Plaça de Catalunya and beyond. I barely heard any noise during the night; woke up on Friday to some lovely opera being played in the neighbourhood, and on Saturday to some smooth jazz.

The bed is comfortable, but lacks a sommier (I actually prefer to sleep that way). A set of clean sheets and towel can be found on the bed as soon as you arrive. To battle the heat, you can either sleep with the balcony door open or use the fan provided in the room. A chair, mirror and small table with drawers are also included for your personal use.

The shower & WC is clean and work as expected. I didn’t use the kitchen so I can’t comment on that aspect of the house.

Pedro is a fantastic host and a unique individual, very easygoing and a pleasure to talk to. He couldn’t be present at the time of my arrival, but promptly arranged for someone to be ready to open the house and show me around.

Barcelona is an amazing place and this room is a superb choice with good value for money. I’ll definitely stay here again in future visits to the city!"
25786,4812981,27-05-2013,2805388,Elisa,"Great location, ambiance and prize. Pedro was kind and make us feel at home.  What else do you need?"
25786,4894464,31-05-2013,6484481,Nanna,"I reallt enjoyed my stay at Pedro's. He is very welcoming, which is nice when you arrive in a foreign country. The apartment is very well-located - with a bit of noise. Not more than you can expect, when you live in the city. Really nice neighborhood.

We felt that we were constantly in the way and he didn't have the time to talk to us or give us any advice even when we asked simple and direct questions. We have stayed with many people all over Europe and Australia through many websites and not felt this uncomfortable before. We could not use the kitchen, it was a great problem that we used the washing machine despite asking, we didn't feel at all like we had any right to be in his home. All in all we were disappointed with our stay with Pedro, I'm sorry"

Laughing all the way. His warm welcome and invitation that I was at home made a lovely arrival. His apartment is Spartan, clean and has everything one could need. But most importantly its Pedro who is the winning card. How kind and willing to help...great directions and bus advise, went to a lot of trouble to get restaurant addresses and beaches to visit. Lovely intriguing conversations, music, laughter and ate a couple of meals together. He is now the kind of person who I would call for sage advise or a good laugh. The song of the moment was ""Sweet as cherry pie and wild as Friday night"" vintage Sade and so Pedro. Made my stay in Barcelona a highlight. Thanks for every thing Pedro. Much love Lucinda"

La ubicación es perfecta si te gusta gracia, como a nosotros. Sin embargo, hay que decir que hay un bar justo debajo y que para dormir se hacía complicado si abres la ventana entra el ruido y si la cierras el calor.
La habitación es muy sencilla, el colchón está directo en el suelo, para mi que estoy embarazada no era lo mas cómodo. 
La limpieza general del piso y en particular del baño bastante deficiente, para mi la limpieza es un punto clave y en ese sentido no me gusto. 
Gracias

The room itself is basic, yet more than adequate with a nice balcony looking out onto one of Gracia's narrow streets. It's a fantastic location in a really lively district of Barcelona, more locals/fewer tourists basically, with some lovely restaurants and bars - just ask Pedro for a recommendation.

Pedro is a great resource on not only Barcelona but a wealth of conservationist and spiritual topics, and we had some great discussions.

25786,97269367,26-08-2016,79782441,정우,"부엌이 있지만 아무것도 요리할수 없었어요. 왜냐하면 그가 채식주의자라 고기냄새를 싫어하거든요. 그는 이사실을 고지했었어야 되는데 그러지 않았습니다.

There was the kitchen, but I couldn't cook ANYTHING, because he was vegetarian, so he hate meat smell. He should have noticed his character.

세탁기가 있지만 빨래를 못했습니다. 심지어 세탁기가 비어있었고 정상인데도요. 물론 사전에 정중하게 써도 되냐고 물어봤는데, 한숨을 푹 쉬더니 처은엔 다음날 쓰라하더니 갑자기 밖에 코인 세탁소를 쓰라하더군요.

There was a washer, but I couldn't use it, EVEN it was empty and works well. 
When I asked the using of the washer polite, first he sighed and admited with annoying. And suddenly, he told me that go outside and use coin washer strongly.

침대는 생각보다 너무 작아서 두명 절대 못씁니다. 선풍기 한대 있는데 고장나있고요. 그는 혼자 에어컨 켜고 잘 자더라고요.

The bed was so tidy. Two persons can't sleep well (even we are not tall)

뭔 부탁이나 질문하면 한숨 푹푹쉬고 무시하는말하고, 한달 유럽여행중에 여기가 숙소 최악입니다.

This house was worst among the hostel, b&b.. etc that i have been in Europe.

25786,98842289,02-09-2016,82875454,Tina Veronica,"Pedro var imøtekommende, vennlig og åpen. Jeg ble møtt med et smil, en klem og fikk en visning i leiligheten. Ble også spurt om å være med å gå en tur til et marked samme dag, dette takket jeg ja til. Det var en fin tur og mye å se! Pedro er lett å snakke med - om alt egentlig - og det er ganske forfriskende. Gjestfriheten var bra!
Jeg fikk komme og gå som jeg ville, så lenge jeg respekterte hans tid også (selvfølgelig). Det var lett og fint å bo med Pedro. Fikk også bestille en tid til ayurvedic massasje av ham (dette anbefales på det sterkeste!). Reiser man alene (hvertfall som kvinne) anbefaler jeg Pedro på det sterkeste! Følte meg trygg og velkommen. Jeg skal definitiv booke hos Pedro igjen neste gang jeg reiser til Barcelona - hvis det er ledig ;)"
25786,100666232,10-09-2016,24981172,Melissa,Wonderful airbnb experience! If you're looking for a warm welcome from a bareclona native this is the place for you. If you're just looking for a bed to sleep in please skip to the next option because it would be a shame to stay and not get to know Pedro. Cozy relaxing apartment in a great neighborhood and even better company ! Can't wait to come back again. Have a couple glasses of wine and make it a party !
25786,101238137,12-09-2016,6423527,Katia,Un momento de paz en el corazon de Gracia. Pedro es simpatico y abierto. Lo recomiendo !
25786,101265633,12-09-2016,6282713,Christophe,"3d time here, and nice to be back. The right place for a true AirBnB feeling : this is the place where Pedro lives. As always, Pedro was welcoming, flexible and kind. I felt at home :)"
25786,103213729,21-09-2016,67228084,Nathan,"My stay at Pedro's place was incredibly unplesant. When I arrived I was rudely greeted and was commanded his rules which I had to abide by. I respect all airbnb hosts need rules as it is their own residence, however Pedro talked down to me and made me feel incredibly uncomfortable and uneasy. After telling me his rules I asked about the laundry facilities he outlined as one of the features he had in his apartment on the airbnb website. Pedro's reply to my enquiry was completely innapropriate and he told me that he didn't want my clothes in his washing machine and that this was reserved for people only staying longer amounts of time (a term he doesnt outline on the website). He told me my only option was to have my clothes cleaned at a laundromat, out of my expense. At this point in time I was uncomfortable and decided to leave, not only had he been rude to me but he didnt fulfill the terms and conditions (this included wifi - his wifi did not work and when I called to get help he wasn't there to assist) set out by airbnb in the fact his listing is completely false and inaccurate. I was fortunate enough airbnb completely refunded me for the amount of paid Pedro. Pedro stated to me that it was essential I communicated with him, before I stayed with him and this I did and I always showed him due respect whenever talking to him, however in summary when the host doesn't at least show you respect back and is rude to you - making you feel uncomfortable to stay at his house (as well as the fact it was listed incorrectly, had no wifi and was in a bad location) this measure of leaving I had to take. I recommend you dont stay with Pedro, he is unplesant and shows no qualities of a good host on airbnb."
25786,103524696,23-09-2016,4319484,Rachel,"Pedro made me feel very welcome, he was helpful and very interesting to chat with.  He has a beautiful energy and a clean home. Thanks Pedro for a great stay.  Next time I'll try to come when the festival is over, so it will be less noisy outside at night!  :-)"
25786,106400917,05-10-2016,448166,Jenny,"Coming from rural Wales, Pedro's place was an oasis of calm and peace in the midst of teeming Barcelona. Highly recommended."

25786,129883311,03-02-2017,3189162,Darío,"Staying in Pedro's house is an interesting experience: he is a kind and warm man who has been living in many places around the world, so he is an amazing host. The room is simple but you have all the things for living in a house. The house is placed in one of the best areas in Barcelona. You can also access easily from the airport with the metro. Even more: Pedro gave me some relaxed and healthy massages! I recommend this house when you travel in Barcelona. Thanks Pedro!!"

The room is cosy and quiet and the bed comfy. Another cool thing is that he is flexible with the arrival time during the day and will do his best to be there when you arrive. As a bonus, Pedro knows lots of beautiful music and does amazing sound effects and whistles :-D I highly recommend staying with him!"

Pedro is a friendly person,  and the communication with him was super easy and quick. My stay was very essential and short but I had a really good feeling. Definitely I would come back.

25786,164931495,29-06-2017,59039158,Daniel,"Pedro was a great host. The house was clean, full of a beautiful fragrance and fresh with the AC. I recommend to anyone staying with him to communicate with him if in doubt about anything concerning the house. 
We stayed with a baby who got sick the very first night and was very fuzzy and noisy during the night. Pedro was really understanding with that difficult situation, he cared about the baby and was sweet and kind at all times. "

25786,180696368,11-08-2017,55438193,Ayla,"My stay was first time with airbnb booking . And im happy for my first was in Pedro's home. His home was basic, comfortable and as-pictured, well located. The pillow and bed are very comfy. İ had a problem about my neck when i arrived there. And Pedro' s magic hand healed it, despite surgery from his shoulder. You should taste his ayurvedic massage! Pedro was great person, indeed a superhost, cute and friendly. İ stayed there as my friend's home. And he helped me for my spanish practice.
Location in Gracia was close to public transportation, bars, shops etc. If you prefer to walk to LaRambla area ( sometimes i did) it takes  a 20-25min. on enjoyable way. Or you can use metro, just 3 stops!  İ liked so much to stay at Gracia area. Would love to stay again in his spirituel home;) Gracias por todo!"

His place is a very quiet apartment, specially taking into account that it's in a pretty busy neighborhood. It's got all the perks of being in a very artsy and genuine area (Gracia) while at the same time it'sat a very short distance from the center of the city and public transportation options.
The room was tidy and clean and absolutely a very great option price-quality in the city of Barcelona ;)"

Vi fik lov til at tjekke ind og ud som vi ville. Da vi kom, var der redt nydeligt op til os med håndklæder. Værelset er super hyggeligt med en dejlig stor madras og dobbeltdyne med en lille altan. Selve lejligheden ligger i det mest hyggelige område af Barcelona (fandt vi), ideelt hvis man gerne vil undgå turistområder. Også nemt med Metro/offentlig transport. Pedro gjorde alt hvad han kunne for at få os til at føle os hjemme og kom med små lokale tips til hvad vi kunne opleve. Lånte os endda paraplyer da det regnede. Alt i alt en rigtig god oplevelse, og vi vil meget gerne komme tilbage en anden gang :) Kan varmt anbefales!"

The bed is really comfortable and I slept well both nights. There are some sounds from the street, but that’s to be expected in the heart of the best district of Barcelona. The whole apartment is equally tasteful and calm. Pedro himself is exceptionally relaxed and friendly, and we communicated well throughout the whole process. I’d give 6 stars if I could - thanks Pedro!"

Pedro is a great host responsive and full of useful local information. Keep in mind the A/C is in the main area of the apartment but not in your room unless you keep the door open. Gracia is a great little neighborhood with a mix of local artists, locals, and some tourist. I would definitely recommend staying here."

근데 방문이 나무문이고 손잡이도 없습니다. 여닫이문에 화장실 개인칸 잠금장치 정도의 잠금이에요. 가장 문제인 것은 방문 아래에 십센치 높이의 구멍이 뚫려있습니다. 

당연히 방음안되고, 빛도 나가고 들어옵니다. 호스트는 화장실 앞에 누워서 잡니다. 무슨말이냐면 당신이 샤워하고 나오면 호스트가 마주보고 누워있다는 뜻이죠. 화장실에 잠금 잠치도 없어요.

매트리스 얇습니다. 거의 바닥에 누워서 잔다고 생각하면 되어요. 신발 신는 문화에 익숙하지 않은 한국인은 당황할 수 있어요. 집 전체에서 향초?냄새가 납니다. 개인실에는 베란다가 있습니다.

혼자 여행하는 여자 게스트에게는 추천하지 않아요. 호스트는 예약과 일정, 체크인 관련해서 편의를 봐주긴 했습니다. 호스트가 나쁜사람인 것 같지는 않아요. 하지만 집구조 상 안정감이나 사생활을 보장받는 느낌을 받기는 어려울 것 같습니다"

The shower only sustains hot water long enough for about a 3-4 minute shower. This was an annoyance as there were 3 of us who had long hair requiring more rinsing and washing. 
There was also an additional resident staying in a room adjacent to ours. He spoke no Spanish or English and only Russian, making communication impossible. We saw him only a couple of times and we were not able to recognize him when banging on the door to let him back in. The last night of our stay he got locked out of the apartment and came home at approximately 1:30 am and woke us to open the door. The host Alex was gracious enough to take phone calls and come to resolve the situation at that late hour but on the eve of a 7am flight the next morning this presented a significant issue. 
That being said our stay was relatively pleasant and we were able to enjoy the city for the most part. The beds were comfortable and the places to see were very close to the apartment. Alex was very nice and accommodating the entire trip. "

My boyfriend and I really enjoyed the place – it has everything you need: full-equipped kitchen with amazing view, cozy living-room with tv, full-functional wifi (not like most places, where the wifi is shit), bright bedroom outlooking the terrace. This apartment felt like home away from home. It was perfect to come back to this place after a long day strolling around Gothic Area, El Born, Rambla. We did a lot of cooking and a lot of hanging out at the flat. Perfect if you want space to be yourselves away from the city centre hassle. The area around the apartment feels local, a lot of old people strolling around, a lot of local shops (supermarkets, cheap cafés) – and you can walk to Park Guell and La Sagrada Familia within twenty minutes.

Die Haustür war schwer aufzuschließen und die Wohnungstür auch nicht leicht zu entriegeln. Insgesamt waren wir sehr zufrieden. Am Abreisetag konnten wir die Wohnung noch bis 16:00 Uhr nutzen.
Wir hätten Lina gerne persönlich kennengelernt. "

31958,15761943,15-07-2014,15888184,Kara,"My husband and I had a wonderful time staying in Lina's place for our Honeymoon. We agreed that we would even love to live there! The view from the patio is absolutely, spectacular. Lina's place made us feel right at home. We had space to store our things and the place was very clean. The apartment is in Gracia, one of the most charming neighborhoods in the city... we had some great food there. If we make it back to Barcelona, we'd be thrilled to stay at Lina's place again!! "
31958,16625309,30-07-2014,9316880,Anthony,"Awesome view does not begin to do this apartment justice. You can lose yourself just drinking wine or coffee on the terrace and staring off into the city or out at the sea. It is incredibly quiet up on the terrace and you are above just about all your other neighbors. Inside the apartment you have a comfortable couch, bed, all the kitchen equipment you could need, great WiFi, and importantly two Air Conditioner units that come in really handy after walking around the city with its heat and humidity.

Lina and her team were great even when my travel plans changed a bit. Getting the keys and a quick walkthrough the apartment upon arrival was quick and painless as well.

The neighborhood is mostly locals, is fairly quiet, and has everything you need within a few blocks in terms of a supermarket, bakery, and restaurants. You can see LA Sagrada Familia from the terrace and can walk there in about 15 minutes. The metro station is about a 5 minute walk and can get you anywhere else you want to go. Absolutely no downside to staying here except the key being finnicky at times : ) "
31958,17933245,19-08-2014,14282603,Ariel,"We stayed in this apartment for almost three weeks.  It was absolutely perfect.  The apartment is very spacious and in a fantastic location.  The metro is a quick walk away. The view is stunning. From the minute we arrived at the apartment, Joan was so helpful.  On a daily basis, he would recommend places to see and restaurants to eat in, as well as how to get there.  I would recommend this apartment to anyone! "
31958,19004250,04-09-2014,6192403,Gisela,"Das Apartment hat uns super gefallen mit fantastischem Blick vom Balkon über die Altstadt bis zum Meer. Vermisst haben wir einen Sonnenschirm und Auflagen für die Sonnenliegen. Nette Einrichtung, sauber, residentielles Haus, nette Wohngegend, gute Anbindung an die Metro. Wir kommen gerne wieder."
31958,20560044,01-10-2014,12594326,Magnus,"A great apartment with a fantastic view nearly in 360 degrees. It's very well equipped and the Internet-connection is fast and reliable. It's a very quiet apartment, not much sound from neighbours or the streets. Check in and all contacts with Lina and her staff went without any problems. Good connections with bus and Metro to the city centre and only a short walk to the heart of Gracia - the most charming part of Barcelona with its many restaurants and bars.
Next time in Barcelona, I'll definitely rent this apartment again!"
31958,21312112,14-10-2014,10001677,Linda,"This is a lovely, comfortable and very quiet apartment in the non-touristy area of Gracia. I actually chose the place based on the guidebook's description of the area being one of the few neighborhoods left in Barcelona with soul.  At first, my heart sunk when I saw the street where the apartment was located. It looked totally anonymous and charmless. But as we got to know the neighborhood we realized that the  small-town feel touted by the guidebook was correct. People arriving in stores and restaurants were greeted by cashiers and owners like old friends. We saw this many times. Best of all, this friendliness was extended to us! We found a small neighborhood bar/restaurant with a menu only in Catalan, filled with locals, and the owner-cashier-waitress made us feel welcome, explaining every item on the menu in Spanish. On our third visit, she kissed us on both cheeks!
Lina responded quickly to our request for booking, and when, on a Sunday night after 9pm, we had a minor problem, she answered within five minutes by text and email.
A few things to mention: our check-in, by someone other than Lina, was quite rushed. In her defense, she had probably been waiting a long time for us, thinking we were arriving by bus and metro from the airport, rather than the two bus route described in Lina's email. I recommend this apartment, but advise future tenants to try out the key while the person checking you in is present.  We found both keys, especially the downstairs one, to be quirky. 
The bed has a bottom sheet and a duvet, no sheet between you and the duvet. I know this is a common practice in homes, but I think a top sheet that is changed after every visitor would be better.
Also, advertising this as a Gaudi penthouse seems a bit of a stretch. Yes, it has a wonderful view from the terrace, which includes Sagrada Familia, and is in the neighborhood where many of Gaudi's buildings can be seen, but the building itself was not designed by Gaudi. 
We would still recommend this lovely apartment to someone who wants to experience a more authentic Barcelona...just be sure you can use the key!"

Gave us lots of helpful tips on Barcelona, a map and a welcome pack giving details of the apartment/local area. Everything was very clean and tidy, and the views from the terrace were spectacular. We had a great time here.
The only slight drawback was that the front door lock was quite difficult to operate - we never got stuck outside, but it often took a couple of minutes to get in."

He gave us an overview of his favorite spots in the city, which was extremely helpful. The apartment exceeded our expectations and we were absolutely blown away by the view from the terrace. The neighborhood is quiet and, in our experience, feels very safe. If we come back to Barcelona, we would absolutely look into staying here again. "

31958,44127658,24-08-2015,24385209,Anna,Awesome is absolutely the best word to describe this penthouse. We had a nice welcome and a good introduction to Barcelona. To sit at the terrass for breakfast and before going to bed was the best with this apartment.  Air con was also appreciated since it was very hot when we visited. We highly recommend to stay here and we would love to stay there again. The neighbourhood was quiet with a grocery close by. 
31958,48349163,25-09-2015,8990335,Fern,"You can tell that this place is used solely for rentals, a bit rundown. 2 lights didn't work.  The patio and view of Sagrada Familia were the highlight. The neighborhood was pleasant except for the road construction."
31958,48898479,29-09-2015,16595680,Jean-Luc,Great flat in a great location. Gracia is the best area to stay in Barcelone with heaps of little cafes and restaurants for tapas. The apartment is very comfortable and we loved having breakfast in the sun while looking over the city. We would definitely stay there again! 
31958,49994075,08-10-2015,41100956,Brian,"First of all, as advertised, the views were incredible!  We enjoyed our stay in the apartment and found it very comfortable.  Marina was helpful in showing us around the apartment, giving us restaurant and site recommendations, and helping us orient to the neighborhood.  We liked the location as well, which is a bit outside of the ""touristy"" areas, but still very convenient.  As mentioned in other reviews, the locks were really tricky.  Marina showed us how to use them, but there were still a few occasions when we were afraid we weren't going to be able to get into the apartment (but it worked out in the end)!   Would  recommend this place to anyone planning a trip to Barcelona. "
31958,50860872,15-10-2015,44391861,Willem Van,"Stayed for one week Oct. 2015. Experience consistent with other reviews. Walking distance to Parc Guell, Sagrada Familia and Hospital de la Santa Creu. Joanic metro 10 min walk, very convenient on yellow line.  Metro easy to navigate (buy 10-trip card). Small grocery stores, bakeries, restaurants all close by (try Tres a la cuina, C/Sant Lluis 35, Gracia;  limited menu but superb food). Quiet neighborhood.  Safe.
Arrived early morning and cd leave bags at apt. at 11 am come back for check-in 3 pm with Marina who was very helpful orienting us to the apt and the city.  Apt as advertised.  Kitchen has all one might need for cooking. Comfortable queen size bed, adequate shower. Lots of natural light.  Very nice terrace. Lift to 6th floor.  Only points with room for improvement: (1) responsiveness to email; and (2) lock to apartment, which definitely needs adjustment.
"
31958,51616669,22-10-2015,18070329,Eduardo,"The view from the apartment was just as epic as we had hoped both from the terrace and the large kitchen windows, quite centrally located and an easy stroll to the subway, the heart of the Gracia neighborhood and the park Guell. Javier met us when we arrived and gave us a very helpful run down on getting around and the location was a perfect home base for exploring beautiful Barcelona. If you are considering this place keep in mind that it is located in a very quiet neighborhood and the terrace is not conducive to any late night partying but still great to sit and chill with a glass of wine, also know that this is very much a vacation rental and not someones home so you will need to make a store run for ALL goods (only a block or so away) and there is no entertainment other than a basic TV so bring a good book and your own CD's as there is no iPod hook up on the stereo, also know there is a washer but no dryer in the apartment, you will need to hang your clothes to dry.  Overall a comfortable, friendly, safe spot and perfect for a couple. "

Looks exactly like advertised, including the view. Amazing sunbathed terrace that was a blessing in the chill of November. The flat itself is very homey, comfortable and welcoming.
Arrival was quick and smooth with all the needed information. 
The area is residential and quiet, with everything you need around, and in a walking distance to more busy areas like Gracia and  Sagrada Familia. If you want to live right in the middle of the busy areas that's not what you'll get. If you want to be outside of the noise but in a well connected location it's a perfect spot. 
One thing to note is that you're asked not to use the terrace between 9pm - 9am. I presume this can be annoying to some if not expected."
31958,55455908,01-12-2015,5812401,Olivia,"We felt very comfortable from the moment we arrived at the apartment. It was clean, spacious and had a lot of light.
Needless to say that the terrasse is the highlight of the apartment. With its spectacular view over the city!
The neighborhood Gracia is super mellow and local, away from all the tourist masses but still close to everything you would possibly need.
I would highly recommend this apartment and will come back too :)"

Cons: This place was pretty dirty. It seemed like our bed linens hadn't been washed (there was sand everywhere?) and I found a dead spider stuck to the bottom of my pillow - really gross. Also, ants in the bathroom and bedroom. Not a TON - but definitely a noticeable amount. "

Cafe & supermarket close by and very close (walking distance- 20 mins maybe less)to Park Guell & the Basillica Sagrada de Familiar. Although we did not meet Lina & Marina we had a helpful friend of theirs called David who helped us settle in., but apart from the initial greeting their was no interaction with the hosts. There are 2 double beds but one is a couch bed and the apartment is clean and serviced by a lift. We had a good stay."

The best place I've stayed in Barcelona! Although this is clearly stated in the rules so no reason for complaint, be aware that you will be charged the late arrival fee if you are only 5 mins later than 9pm so a top tip is try and arrive on time!"

It was very clean and the essentials provided (towels, duvets, extra pillows etc) were great. The kitchen was very well equipped allowing us to cook with ease. 
The location was relatively far from the centre. It was about a 7-10 minute walk to the nearest metro station, but it was quite easy to reach all the touristic attractions using public transport. It was however walking distance from Guell Park which was nice!

The apartment is basic, but clean and has everything you need - it's a perfect sized space for a couple.  Gracia is a fantastic area, and you are minutes from anything you need, including transport.  Great restaurants, spaces and bars and you are out of the tourist trap areas.  We ended up spending most of our time in Gracia as it felt so local.

Our flight was delayed 12 hours and we were met at 1am at the apartment by David, which was entirely reassuring.  We were in touch with Lina during the day re our flight delay and apartment check in times, and replies were pretty much instant. David gave us the run down of the area which was great, despite it being 1am!  

I wouldn't hesitate to book here again.  Missing the view already!

The location, near Park Güell is an asset. The proximity of the metro too. Unique small apartment on the top floor, the terrace and the view are very nice; simple and comfortable, the apartment now seems destined mainly for rent.

Es gibt sogar einen CD-Player und eine Auswahl an CDs dort.

He gave us all the information about the apartment and about the city. It was a pleasure to talk with him. "

Communication on arrival was a little bit difficult: the guy that answered the phone hung up on us the first 2 times we called.

I don't now if 'Lina y Marina' exist, this apartment is rented by a company Barcelona apartments. This is the only disappointment: it's not clear from the advertisement that this is a company.

No shower supplies.

31958,126607805,13-01-2017,49913041,채원,"숙소는 역에서 10분가량 떨어져있고 숙소가는 길에 빵집과 슈퍼마켓이 많아 먹거리를 충분히 사실 수 있습니다. 아파트는 매우 깨끗하고 넓었으며 침실에서 본 뷰는 매우 훌륭합니다. 화장실과 주방 모두 사용하는데 불편함이 없었으며, 숙소에 엘레베이터가 있어 오르내리는데 편했습니다. 

The accommodation is about 10 minutes away from the station and there are many bakery and supermarkets on the way so you can buy enough food.The apartment is very clean and spacious and the view from the bedroom is very good.Both toilets and kitchens were comfortable. There is an elevator that is useful."

31958,133249216,21-02-2017,5590462,Ariana,"The apartment is in a great location - very close to multiple subway lines, and to great restaurants and cafes. It is also walkable to the center of the city (if you are up for a long, but beautiful, walk!). The views from the apartment are remarkable, the deck is huge and overlooks the whole city. The amenities are basic - no kitchen basics, soap, or toothpaste, but the location and the apartment itself make up for whatever is missing. Comfortable, convenient, and clean."

31958,146565874,23-04-2017,64426203,Julian,"We had a great time in the apartment. The view from the terrace is spectacular and the kitchen is well-equipped. We particularly enjoyed staying in the Gracia neighbourhood. It offers many nice squares with restaurants and bars. Gracia is also not overrun by tourists. Metro stations are, however, close by and getting to the city centre or other parts of town is thus quite easy."
31958,147510423,27-04-2017,378466,Rose,"We would stay here again in a heartbeat. We enjoy walking so we generally shunned the metro and the elevator, and it was a pleasant walk to the center of Barcelona. It is a large, beautiful apartment with a fabulous view and big balcony. The kitchen was well-equipped. There was a lot of helpful information about Barcelona, such as places to eat and sights to see, provided by the host. I would be remiss if I did not recommend having breakfast at Brunch & Cakes, one of the highlights of our trip. Thank you!"
31958,148201708,30-04-2017,93498676,Robert And Lilia,"This apartment was exactly what we needed for our stay in Barcelona. The bedroom was simple but spacious. The kitchen was excellent, clean, and slightly more modern than the rest of the apartment. The bathroom was a bit dated and not quite as clean but it was sufficient for our usage.

If the weather is nice for your stay, there is no way that you wouldn't enjoy the terrace. We had perfect, panoramic views of downtown and a dream breakfast spot. Even the views from the kitchen were gorgeous.

The walk to public transportation is quick and easy. We loved Barcelona's public transit. The walk to Park Guell was a perfect distance after breakfast.

We had a great check-in experience with Roger. He was very helpful and extremely informative. He made sure that we would be headed in the right directions and answered all of our questions with professionalism and a smile. The staff involved with booking this apartment was very, very helpful. 10/10!

When we come back to Barcelona, we hope this apartment is available!"

As a heads up, the visitor's tax mentioned in the posting is not included in the price so you will need a few Euros per night per person handy when checking in.

Quick walk to the metro and La Sagrada. The location is definitely a little out of the way-- feels pretty residential, but was nice to come home to. There are plenty of restaurants in Grácia nearby too!"

Only 1 out of 3 days was there any hot water for the shower and the bed is less than comfortable. The roof too terrace makes up for it though! The pictures don't do it any justice! "
31958,155023516,27-05-2017,20210083,Nalynn,"We had a great stay at this apartment in this cute and hip little neighborhood Gracia. It is a great choice for travelers who like to stay in a more residential area closer to locals, but also within easy access of all of the sights (it's a stone's throw from the metro). It is in easy walking distance from the tons of great restaurants, bars, boutiques, and the great shopping district that Gracia has to offer. The views from the private rooftop patio cannot be beat! "
31958,157968652,05-06-2017,10672065,Michael,"Wir haben unseren Aufenthalt im Apartment genossen.

Die Terrasse mit Blick auf Sagrada Familia und das Meer ist das Highlight der Wohnung. Bei schönem Wetter kann man von früh bis spät in der Sonne liegen.

Die Lage ist sehr gut. Nahe der U-Bahn-Station (Joanic) wohnt man in einem netten Stadtteil mit Supermärkten, Cafes, Bars. Zu den wirklichen netten Highlights in Gracia ist es nicht weit. Und der Park Guell ist gleich in der Nähe und zu Fuß locker zu erreichen. 
Mit der U-Bahn ist man in ca 15 Minuten im Zentrum und in Strandnähe.

Das Apartment war ziemlich sauber, die Küche ist mit dem Notwendigsten ausgestattet. Klimaanlage OK. WLAN top!


Nicht so toll:
Die Auflagen für die Sonnenliegen waren leider schon sehr abgenutzt/schmutzig.
kleine Couch, Mini-TV (nur bei Schlechtwetter notwendig)
Das Licht auf der Terrasse ist kaputt.
Keine Privatvermietung.

Also, check out El Rusc nearby for good Mexican food."
31958,198111636,28-09-2017,67060098,Sylvie,"The view was great. However, the bed was uncomfortable, the check in manager was a bit rude, and the apartment needed updating. But the view is unbeatable! 
One of the main issues was that the owner stopped by unannounced and asked to go into the apartment to look for something. Then inside the apartment he asked about our belongings lying around, whether those were our car keys and if we were sure there are only 2 people visiting. I don't know what his basis for those questions were, as we kept the apartment tidy. I felt the owner was quite intrusive. 
Also be aware if you stay here they write down your passport information and you have to pay a pretty steep tax. I guess this is normal in Barcelona, but I haven't experienced it before.  
Lastly, the people of Barcelona make it clear they do not want tourists in the city- there is anti tourist graffiti all throughout the area where the apartment is located. We are American, and they stared us down on the sidewalk everywhere we went. I personally do not recommend visiting Barcelona at all. But if you are... this is an okay place to stay, safe and away from the touristy areas."
31958,199889766,03-10-2017,36024926,Alexander,"All in all we enjoyed our stay in this apartment. Its located very close to bus and metro stations, supermarkets, restaurants and other small shops, so this is a big plus. You don't need more than 20-30 minutes to most of the sight seeing spots. The apartment itself is a bit older, which is no problem, although the sunchairs on the beautiful terrace (great view!) maybe want to be replaced by new ones ;) 
We had some problems to get hot water in the shower sometimes also. 
The checkin was very good and we got all the information we needed, very friendly as well. Considering its not the most expensive place in Barcelona, i can recommend this. Thanks for hosting us!"

Décue de l'accueil!"
31958,225369181,06-01-2018,161881927,Georg,"Beim Appartment handelt es sich um einen in diesem Wohngebiet ortstypischen Aufbau auf dem Flachdach eines achtgeschossigen Wohnhauses. Es ist bis zum 7. Stock per Aufzug und dann über eine Treppe zu erreichen. Das Appartment ist von seiner Lage und Ausstattung her ein idealer Ort für einen mehr oder weniger langen Aufenthalt in der katalanischen Metropole Barcelona. Es ist alles vorhanden, was man zur Selbstversorgung braucht (u.a. Bettwäsche, Hand- und Badetücher, Küche mit allem Nötigen auch für die Zubereitung anspruchvollerer Gerichte). Der Blick von der Terasse auf die Stadt und das Meer, ebenso wie auf die rückwärtige, Barcelona begrenzende Hügelkette ist im Wandel der tageszeitlich unterschiedlichen Sonneneinstrahlung und Lichtverhältnisse fantastisch. Die Innenstadt von Barcelona mit ihren Sehenswürdigkeiten sowie der Hafen und die verschiedenen Strände der Stadt sind schnell und leicht zu erreichen (z.B. von der nahegelegenen Metrostation Joanic aus). Die Distanzen in Barcelona sind so bemessen, dass sie von Personen ohne Geheinschränkungen auch gut zu Fuß bewältigt werden können. Das Appartment ist mit je zwei Schlafplätzen in den zwei Haupträumen zwischen Außenterasse an dem einen Ende und kleiner Küche am anderen Ende ausgestattet. Optimal ist es mit einem Paar belegt, welches das bequeme Doppelbett im trassenseitigen Zimmer benutzt. Bei der Nutzung der Schlafstätten in beiden Haupträumen (z.B. bei einer Belegung mit drei oder vier Personen) entsteht eine ""Durchgangszimmersituation"",  etwa wenn vom küchenseitigen Zimmer aus die Terasse oder vom terassenseitigen Zimmer aus Küche oder Duschbad/Toilette benutzt werden. Je nach beiteiligten Personen muss das allerdings nicht zu einem Problem führen. Die Kommunikation via Internet mit Lina sowie die Einweisung nach der Ankunft vor Ort liefen perfekt. Wichtig noch zu erwähnen: vom Flughafen aus ist das Appartment leicht und kostengünstig zu erreichen: erst mit dem Shuttlebus vom Flughafen zur Plaza de Catalunya (pro Person 5,60 €), dann von dort mit Bus oder Metro in die Nähe des Apartments (Metrostation Joanic; Buslinie und Ausstiegsstation s. Angaben von Lina). Der Taxipreis vom Flughafen zum Apartment beträgt nach den Angaben am Flughafen ca. 90 Euro. "
31958,226561081,11-01-2018,11171329,Marion,We had a wonderful 3 night break at Linas place in Barcelona which is conveniently situated on the hill leading up to Parc Guell for the Gaudi lovers out there . (book in advance ) Having suggestions and directions from Valery really helped us plan our break and the terrace was a great space even in January
31958,227566356,15-01-2018,14436583,Cédric,The appartment is to a walkable distance to many of Barcelona's touristic attractions. The terrasse is a real plus as it gives you a panoramic view over all the city. Gracia is a very nice neighboorhood full of restaurants and bars. Good experience overall.
31958,230498219,28-01-2018,139583915,Stefanie,"Super Unterkunft mit allem, was man braucht. Die Küchenausstattung war top, so dass es uns an nichts gefehlt hat zum Kochen, sogar inkl. Geschirrspüler. Im Bad war neben einem Föhn auch ein kleines Glätteisen vorhanden. Lina hat uns sogar ein Reisebett fürs Baby zur Verfügung gestellt, das war wirklich super. Die Aussicht ist super - über die Terasse kann man zum Meer blicken und aus der Küche in die Berge. Lediglich die Fenster sind sehr undicht, so dass es schnell kalt wird (Klimaanlage kann als Heizung genutzt werden) und die Küchenfenster klappern. 

Das Appartement ist über einen (winzigen) Aufzug bis zur 5. Etage erreichbar, dann muss man noch eine Etage eine enge Treppe nach oben - mit Kinderwagen recht beschwerlich, aber machbar. 

Die Lage ist zwar etwas außerhalb des Zentrums (ca. 40 Minuten zu Fuß), jedoch gibt es eine sehr gute Anbindung mit Bussen (Haltestellen für verschiedene Linien im Umkreis von 2-5 Minuten Fußweg) und Metro (ca. 7-10 Minuten Fußweg)."

31958,239107557,28-02-2018,159381565,Eduardo,"Para evaluar nuestra estancia en Barcelona la debo dividir en dos aspectos, uno el apartamento y por otro lado la calidad del host. El  apartamento es como se ve en las fotos, para tres personas. Con una linda terraza con vista a la ciudad y otra vista desde la cocina hacia el park guell muy bonita. El apartamento está a 600 mts de la estación del metro Joanic de la L4 que permite llegar a todos los puntos de interes de Barcelona. El apartamento tiene una heladera que funciona mal, congela o no enfría, la cama y el sofá son incómodos y las almohadas insuficientes y de mala calidad. El caudal de la ducha es pobre, y tuve que destapar el desagote de la ducha. Las paredes de la cocina precisan un arreglo por la humedad. En conclusión un apartamento de escasa calidad. Con respecto al host...el día 28 de febrero dejábamos el departamento con destino a Nápoles, el día 27 debido a la tormenta llamada ""la bestia del este"" Nápoles sufrio una nevada que obligo a cerrar su aeropuerto y el servicio de transporte. Ante esta situación consultamos si podríamos quedarnos un día más en caso que esta situación no cambiase. Nunca nos contestaron hasta 25 horas después, cuando ya habíamos podido viajar. No esperábamos un socorro, sólo una respuesta para prevenir una situación que nos dejara en la calle en caso de no poder viajar. No lo recomiendo."

Lejligheden levede fuldstændig op til vores forventninger - og udsigten var om muligt endnu mere fantastisk, end vi kunne forestille os, det var en oplevelse i sig selv at sidde på tagterrassen og bare nyde udsigten og byen under os. Alt var fint og rent og helt perfekt for os :)
Den korte afstand til Park Guell, Sagrada Familia og metroen som bla. førte os direkte til byens centrum og stranden levede også op til alle vores ønsker og forventninger.
Al kommunikation samt afhentning og aflevering af nøgler var endvidere nemt og helt uden problemer.

31958,310834081,20-08-2018,126623676,Maria Alejandra,"The apartment has a beautiful view. But I will only recomend it if the host ,(which is a rental company and you only realize this when the reservation is done...and you need to get the keys elsewhere which is a waist of time), make serious changes and maintenace: wall paint is old and cracking, floors are in bad shape, shower clogs (recurrent problem as per other reviews) , furniture on the terrace is old and it seems dirty, broken exterior lamp and lamp pots and so on. However, the place was very clean and located in a nice neighborhood ( a bit far from city center). People in the agemcy (friendly rentals) are not that friendly (no smile) and seems bothered by your presence, but they are very reactive. I rather prefer a host to explain things and not this method."

31958,411418891,12-02-2019,233551762,Delilah,"This is a good place to stay if you know in advance a couple of key things , 
Bring your own toilet tissue , paper towels , coffee and condiments for tea or coffee . This place only supplies enough for a couple of days. (We had a 5 day stay )
After travelling hours and hours to get to Barcelona, you have to go to a corporate out of the Way location to check in . Then tell your taxi to wait or find extremely difficult parking ( if you have car) so that you can go get keys , and sign paperwork . This is by far the worst part because you’re just ready to stop travelling and relax. 
In the flat :
The heater if staying while cold , only works in bedroom. You’ll have to leave the bedroom door open at all times to somewhat warm the flat . 
The lift ( elevator) does NOT go up to hour top floor. I wished I had know that ahead of time. It stops at the floor below and you must go up 17 stairs to top. ( with your luggage!!) 
If you can handle all above  , you’ll love the flat . Everything is as described and the view is absolutely lovely . The flat itself was extremely clean and the television had a good variety of channels on it . The bathroom is nice and again , everything is exceptionally clean. It is a nice flat ."

I loved the patio, it is perfect for dinner or relaxing with a glass of wine. If you want to be in the middle of the action this is not the place for you. It is a great eclectic neighborhood for someone who is independent and likes to (Website hidden by Airbnb) about a 15 min metro ride to las Ramblas or barcelonetta area.

We had it comfortable there, but it would have been better if the metro would have been closer. But anyway it was not so far to the metro and it was easy to get a taxi almost just outside the door. The neighbourhood was also nice and with a litle walk down the street it was alot of small shops. The host was very nice and polite."

There are two very large terraces also well equipped and with good vistas.  The beds are very comfortable.

Being on the top floor the water pressure is a little under par so it requires a little bit of patience to figure out how to get the best shower. 

There is good food and wine shopping nearby.   The nearest metro is Joanic which is a 7 minute walk downhill ... and a 7 minute walk back up hill, but it is easy to hail a cab from the end of the street.

This is a charming retreat from the busy downtown and I thank our hosts for making their home available to us."

32471,44719827,28-08-2015,13445147,Simone,"il soggiorno nell'appartamento è stato gradevole. sicuramente un punto di forza sono le due terrazze, una ampia al piano del soggiorno, molto utile per mangiare con bella vista su Tibidabo e Sacro Cuore e soprattutto quella al piano superiore con splendida vista su tutta Barcellona.. davvero da vedere!
anche il check in è andato bene perché ci sono state date tutte le spiegazioni, suggerimenti per visitare Barcellona con molta calma e gentilezza.
a mio parere una parte del mobilio (specialmente nella camera) dovrebbe essere rinnovata ed i divani un po' più puliti. attenzione perché l'area condizionata è presente solo nelle camere, e non nella sala.
in ogni caso ci ritornerei volentieri, e consiglio il soggiorno a tutti

32471,46826884,13-09-2015,1447604,Karla,"El apartamento esta en buenas condiciones a pesar de ser viejo, los baños y cocina están remodelados. Buena nevera y se puede lavar la ropa en verano al secarla en la terraza. La zona no ayuda si no andas en coche, esta ubicado en una subida y no hay muchos sitios para comer a walking distance. La razón por la cual lo alquilamos fue para usar la terraza, la cual no se puede usar desde las 11PM hasta las 9AM, que es cuando realmente un turista esta en el piso. El Edificio y apartamento huelen un poco a viejo. Es ideal para dos parejas y un niño por el tamaño. Muy buena vista de ambos lados con dos terrazas.

Fueron incumplidos al realizar el check in (que debe ser a las 3PM) se tardaron dos horas en llegar, tuvimos que esperar una hora mas de lo acordado (nos pidieron hacer check in a las 4pm), no avisaron que iban a llegar tarde y no nos permitieron hacer late check out. A las 11AM nos pidieron irnos. Si no te dejan entrar temprano deberían dejarte ir mas tarde por educación. 

Esta bien para una familia que desee tener un apartamento espacioso con terrazas, sin hacer ruido de noche, en zona residencial.

No recomendado para personas mayores, hay que subir escaleras para ir a los cuartos y esta ubicado en una loma."

So, there were a couple of negatives surrounding the apartment which I'll mention below, but ignore them.  The place was so, so good - the sun terraces had the most incredible view and captured the sun (and heat!) from sunrise to sunset.  We sat for hours admiring the city from here. :-)

Location was also fantastic, being a five minute walk from Joanic station which was well connected to the rest of the city.  The neighbourhood was quiet and safe.

So - a brief touch on the negatives.  The shower was truly, truly terrible.  No pressure and cycled from scolding hot to freezing.  Also, almost all of the power sockets in the master bedroom (that led to the terrace) were not working.  

The two main bedrooms were great (with excellent air conditioning!), but the third room was a little small and perhaps only suitable for a child.

Well recommended, a fantastic stay!

Es war ein bisschen leichthörig, u.a. mit einigen im Haus wohnhaften Hunden. Alle Distanzen zu Metro, Einkaufsläden etc. sind zu Fuss gut machbar, aber nichts ist wirklich gleich um die Ecke. Ebenso ist das zentrale Gracia Quartier ein bisschen entfernt."

Only 700 meters away from Park Güell. "
32471,58395188,02-01-2016,26749975,Tessa,"The apartment itself was beautiful!   Amazing views, great amenities, and good location.  It's in a more local neighbourhood so you get a more genuine feel of Barcelona - yet it's only a short walk to the Gracia area where great bars and restaurants are located.

The only thing was that you had to call the host when you arrived in Barcelona. This made it difficult to meet up since we didn't have a cellphone and I had no idea how to use the phonebooth (and I lost a few Euros in the process!)   As a result, we had to wait outside the apartment for the host to arrive.

I didn't get to meet Lina or Marina as this is actually a company that owns a whole bunch of apartments in Barcelona.  But despite it not being a private home, they still made us feel very welcome.

Thanks again!

Older plumbing and problem with hot water, drainage etc...

It's a quiet area but still with good shops for food, small places for eating and nice little places for coffee and snacks. Close to Park Güel with fantastic view over the city and also close to other landmarks. The apartment is very nice and especially the two terraces are fantastic morning, day and evening. The apartment is also very well equipped for own cooking, which we did a lot. Nice access with elevator and very quiet in the evening.
There is air-condition in 2 bedrooms but not in the third (and very small) bedroom. Makes the 3rd bedroom very warm in the summer.
But all in all a very good apartment in a very good location. Full recommendation from us if you need a spacious place with fantastic view of the city. "

It is a bit far from the city centre if you only want to go for short walks, there is a subway stations only about 500-800 meters away that will take you into the centre in only 2-3 stops. It has great views of the city from the two terraces, one facing the city centre and the other one the hills of Parc Guell. The good thing about the two terraces is that one will always be in the sun. The living room downstairs is great for relaxing. Two of the bedrooms are a good size, the third one is quite small. There are small supermarkets just a block away, and also small bars and restaurants, Lalola being a really nice place for tapas with great staff. In Gracia there alot of modern and hip restaurants, worth checking out if you are tired of toursit spots and wants to explore the local atmosphere.

Roger meet us at the apartment at night and was very polite, we never meet Lina but she always responded.

The door to the building has a cumbersome and blunt lock that is difficult to open in the beginning, the trick is to insert the key, pull it out just a millimeter while turning it a little to the right and then turn it open to the left. :)"

Das Apartment liegt ca. 15-20 Min vom Plaza Cataluna entfernt, die nächste Metro-Station ist ca. 7 Min zu Fuss zu erreichen. Für Ankunft und Abreise ist ein Taxi zu empfehlen, da das Apartment nur über einen kleinen steilen Hügel zu erreichen ist. 
Abgesehen von den ungereinigten Terrassen (Dose, Zigarettenstummel vom Vorgänger) war das Apartment im Grossen und Ganzen sauber. 

Pluspunkt:
- problemlose Kommunikation
- fantastischer Ausblick beider Terrassen
- top WLAN

Minuspunkt:
- fehlender Sonnenschutz auf beiden Terrassen
- die obere Terrasse mit dem schöneren Ausblick darf nur bis Punkt 22 Uhr genutzt werden, danach wird man unfreundlich vom Nachbarn auf die untere Terrasse ""geschickt""
- das Geschirr musste vor Gebrauch abgespült werden, da es sehr dreckig war - möglicherweise wegen der schlecht funktionierenden Spülmaschine
- fehlende Ventilatoren im Wohnzimmer/Schlafzimmer mit Einzelbett, da dort keine Klimaanlage vorhanden ist
- das untere Bad (nur WC) riecht sehr unangenehm 

Platz bietet es für 5 Personen, für weitere Personen dürfte es sehr eng werden. 

Alles in allem ein angenehmer Aufenthalt, welcher - bis auf kleinere Mängel - weiter zu empfehlen ist."
32471,164615562,28-06-2017,3846215,Sara,"The best thing about this accommodation is surely the terraces. I mean, what more can you ask for than stunning views over Barcelona, in every direction? For me, that is what I want. The rest of the place is lovely too and it got all amenities you need, although you need to restock a few things yourself like shower cream and toilet paper, but that's kind of what airbnb is anyway. The area is lovely too, close to Güell park. We walked to the city center a few times, but subway is also close. Food stores close by. Cat café close by :)

The small room is too warm to sleep in without air condition or fan, but if no fan is found, ask Lina and she will fix it. Overall, highly recommended!"

Lejligheden passer perfekt hvis I også selv vil lave mad og slappe af hjemme midt på dagen. Køkkenet rummer alt man behøver - terrassen med udsigt er perfekt om aftenen, mens morgenmad og frokost kan nydes på den anden terrasse. Fint badeværelse ved soveværelserne.

Very noisy with traffic at night so bring earplugs or get a white noise app on your phone.  Disappointed that we paid for a half bath that we were told was ""broken"", and had a terrible septic smell coming from it that permeated into kitchen/dining area.  It finally got fixed on our 3rd day.  We did appreciate that Lina gave us some local restaurants to go to for New Year's Eve and we did go to Xavier and it was great.

The only issue we found was that if you wanted to use the the balcony after 7pm we had the aggressive neighbour below shouting and making rude gestures at us. The same with making any sort of noise past 9pm inside, maybe past 10/11pm is fair, but talking to friends and having fun after 9pm seemed to be frowned upon by him.  

Other than the neighbour issue we had a fantastic stay and would 100% stay again. "

Fully furnished, amazing terraces, good localisation (Parc Guell at 10min, and for those who like to discover by walk, it's 40min from La Rambla), ...  The furnitures look a bit old but are still functional. We slept really well in bedrooms with confortable beds, and A/C. In the morning, we can hear the life in the street, but as it's not a main road,  it's generally quiet. For the people coming by car like us, there's a parking garage really close that take only 21€ for the 24h! Well, I recommend this flat!"
32471,295316807,23-07-2018,166557789,Luca,"We arrived and the place was spotless. There was plenty of room for the 4 others I was staying with, and the views from both balconies are far better than the pictures. Perfect location for the city in my opinion, although getting back from nights out was sometimes difficult. This place was amazing and I'd definitely return and recommend to anyone looking for a 10/10 in Barcelona. One thing - the neighbours are very strict on noise, which I didn't feel was stressed enough, but it can be resolved easily, and they just deserve a bit of respect essentially. "
32471,299018568,30-07-2018,172637868,Karsten,"Wow! The views from both terraces are extraordinary and covers most of the city. The flat it self is nice, clean and perfectly cut for 4 persons. The fifth bed is a single bed in a little tight room with poor ventilation. We used the room only for storage. 
The kitchen is very nice and we recommend to use it and sit on the terrace and eat.
Around the neighborhood you will find plenty of grocery shops and restaurants. The metro is only 10 minutes walk away. The Park Güell (Gaudi) is just 15 minutes walk away.

In Danish: Anbefales!! Fin lejlighed med super beliggenhed. Vi er to voksne og to teenagers. Lejligheden er slidt men alt virker og køkken og bad er nyere. Vær opmærksom på at gæsteværelset ikke er velegnet til andet end opbevaring og omklædning. Den nederste terrasse er i tilknytning til stue og køkken og har et fint bord med stole til fire personer. Vi brugte den hver dag både morgen og aften. Den øverste terrasse har fuld sol hele dagen og bliver meget varm. Perfekt til solbadning og eventuelt en eftermiddags-drink. 
Lejligheden har opvaskemaskine og vaskemaskine. Det store badeværelse har en super bruseniche. Der var fint med sengelinned og håndklæder til alle. Lejligheden administreres af ""Friendly Rentals"" og det er der man henter nøglen. Til gengæld skal man ikke tilbage med nøglen ved ud checkning. Der forlader man lejligheden og smækker døren. Det er fint.
OBS: Naboerne er meget tæt på og der er stilleperiode fra klokken 22 til 08, i henhold til kontrakten. Naboen bad os om ikke at bruge den øverste terrasse om aftenen fordi det forstyrrede. Men der er generelt en meget fin service i butikker og ved attraktioner. Og de fleste beboere kan tale engelsk, hvis de vil.
Transport: På baggrund af bedre ankomst- og afrejsetider i Barcelona valgte vi at køre til Hamborg og flyve med Vueling (stort spansk flyselskab). Vi bestilte parkering online og det virkede perfekt.
Fra lufthavnen i Barcelona brugte vi bussen ""Aerobüs"" til Placa Catalunya og gik til kontoret for at få nøglen. Derfra tog vi taxa til lejligheden (15 EUR). Ellers anvendte vi metroen og købte 3-dages kort til 22,- EUR per styk i automaterne på stationerne.
Vi gør det gerne igen!!

32471,402083875,17-01-2019,5578224,Kenneth,"This is a great apartment in a wonderful, quiet location, halfway between Parc Guell and La Sagrada Familia. The views from the two terraces are incredible and expansive, not possible to fully depict in photos. We were there for 16 nights and made good use of the clean, modern, well-equipped kitchen. There were a couple of technical issues upon our arrival and they were handled quickly and attentively by the management company, Friendly Rentals."
32711,377652,17-07-2011,550342,Louise,The apartment and location was as described - fantastic! it provided us a real living Barcelona experience.  We would definitely recommend.  Nick was a great host.
32711,1999156,16-08-2012,1729029,Johanna,"We had two family's and hired both apartments, the second floor apartment was re furbished rather recently and was very good, the third floor apartment, was still in reasonable shape but desperately needed to have the air conditioning attended too.
Nick was a fantastic host, extremely helpful, assisting us with hiring taxis, suggesting good eating spots and offering advice and help when needed.
The area was good, just far enough from the real action but till near to good restaurants and shopping."
32711,3453278,01-02-2013,2783066,Adele,"Our stay at Nick's apartment was comfortable and perfectly adequate, especially at the January low season price per night.  The apartment was clean and sufficiently furnished.  Nick was prompt responding to questions and he was accommodating.  The issue of the hot water regularly and frequently turning cold needs to be resolved however.  "
32711,3654789,28-02-2013,5001874,Manfred,"Ich war zusammen mit einem Kollegen während des Mobile World Congress in Barcellona drei Tage in diesem Apartement. Es ist zentral gelegen und vom Balkon kann man die Baufortschritte an der Sagarda Familia mitverfolgen. Das Apartment ist super geschnitten und ist topp ausgestattet.Da der Februar für spanische Verhältnisse äußerst kalt war, konnten wir auch die super funktionierende Heizung in der Wohung testen. Das Apartment ist sehr stilvoll eingerichtet und sehr gepflegt. Wer gerne im Web surft, für den ist ein PC in der Wohnung, über den auf das Internetz zugegriffen werden kann. Zum super netten Vermieter Nick Lockie kann man nur sagen, dass er immer erreichbar war und uns behilflich war, wo er nur konnte (Website hidden by Airbnb)"
32711,5013103,07-06-2013,6585212,Annette,"This apartment was perfect for our stay in Barcelona.  It was very close to La Sagrada Familia, and we took that to our advantage.  There were always cabs there to take around the city.  Also, with my limited Spanish, it was an easy location for us to tell cab drivers as a destination.  The apartment was clean and well kept.  It was located on a fairly quiet street in a very busy city, and this was greatly appreciated.
Nick was also an amazing host. He was quick to respond with details and help.  He provided a lot of great recommendations for local places to eat, and we definitely appreciated the advice.
I highly recommend the apartment, and I would easily stay in this place again or in another of Nick's apartments."
32711,7572792,24-09-2013,8641126,Joyce,"Nick is a fantastic host, he really took the time to tell us about the city especially what to avoid.  Do yourself a favor and use his indoor parking spot and save yourself the headaches of street parking on weekdays.  The apartment was very well equipped.  Highly recommend Nick and any of his units."
32711,10568168,25-02-2014,2593745,Andreas,NIck was a very attentive and correct host. Thank you Nick !
32711,21449600,17-10-2014,8368076,Michele,"Nous avons été enchantés par l'apartement et surtout sa situation géographique. Tout près de la Sagrada Familia, dans un quartier très agréable et calme.  Il correspondait à sa description. Un petit bémol toutefois, le grand sofa ainsi que le fauteuil n'étaient pas très propres. Pour le reste, impeccable. A proximité de tout . j'y retournerais sans hésiter."
32711,32275061,16-05-2015,28114790,Domitille,"Notre séjour s'est très bien déroulé, Nick est très accueillant et nous a bien expliqué la situation de l'appartement qui est idéalement situé : boulangerie au pied de l'immeuble, moyennes surfaces à 2 minutes à pied, métro Sagrada Familia à 5 minutes à pied… Le logement était idéal pour deux adultes et deux jeunes enfants et tout à fait conforme aux photos du site, il y avait juste un couchage de plus dans la chambre des enfants. Les deux chambres donnent sur l'arrière et sont donc au calme, le séjour donne sur une rue assez bruyante mais cela ne nous a pas dérangé. Bref, on recommande ce logement."
32711,41615139,08-08-2015,35813556,Tanika,"We had a lovely time in Barcelona and really loved the apartment. It was so conveniently close to the Sagrada Familia and the neighbourhood was very pleasant.  (In fact you could see Sagrada from the balcony). First evening we had a delicious meal in a local restaurant which was very reasonable.  
The apartment was spacious, with a well equipped kitchen and good sized bedrooms. It was very hot and humid in Barcelona but the apartment had great air-conditioning and fans in the bedrooms. All in all, this was perfect for us."
32711,48253465,24-09-2015,33465357,Adam,"Let me start by saying that Nick was an excellent host. We had booked an apartment with another host and upon arrival was informed there was no hot water or internet. We cancelled the reservation and quickly needed to find another place. I saw Nick's place and contacted him. His response was quick and within an hour we were set up in his apartment. Nick was also very informative of the area.

The apartment was clean, spacious, and had everything we needed for an enjoyable stay. Being only a few blocks from Sagrada Familia the location was excellent. Easy access to the metro and a quick ride to all the sights.

I would recommend staying here and can't thank Nick enough for the help we received."
32711,57118231,22-12-2015,44695768,宇一郎,ｻｸﾞﾗﾀﾞﾌｧﾐﾘｱの近辺の割と静かで生活感のあるｱﾊﾟｰﾄでした｡近くにｽｰﾊﾟｰやｶﾌｪも多く､少しゆっくり滞在するには便利な場所だと思います｡(7泊しました｡)お部屋も広いﾘﾋﾞﾝｸﾞと小奇麗なﾍﾞｯﾄﾞﾙｰﾑやｷｯﾁﾝがあり､快適でした｡ﾎｽﾄのNickは対応が早く､非常に感じがよかったです｡3歳と1歳の子供2人を連れていったのですが､近くの公園の情報や子供が病気になった際には病院の情報などをすぐに教えてくれました｡(SMSでやりとりしていましたが､ﾚｽﾎﾟﾝｽは非常に早かったです｡)ｺｽﾄﾊﾟﾌｫｰﾏﾝｽも含めて､全体的に非常に満足しています｡
32711,59631744,13-01-2016,22933065,Carlos,"Nick fue muy amable y flexible ante el cambio de fechas. El apartamento está muy cerca de Sagrada Familia, y hay muchos bares, cafés y supermercados cerca."
32711,71808360,28-04-2016,65789557,Jean François,"Notre hôte est charmant, l'appartement est bien situé, bonne taille pour 4. Un petit rafraichissement pour retrouver le charme des photos et une cafetière classique ou nespresso pour remplacer les vieilles italiennes."
32711,102168640,17-09-2016,53179293,Martin,"A great base five minutes from the Sagrada Familia and metro with small supermarkets bakeries and some restaurants very close by. Flat on 3rd floor, spacious and clean and pretty much as described (just a few tweaks to get it tip top) and we thought very good value. Very comfortable for the two of us. Pre-departure information and service from Nick was excellent - made us very welcome, felt very confident about the whole process. We stayed 12 nights so had plenty of time to explore and relax in the apartment. The flat is so close to the metro and the main sights are just a few short stops away - Old Town, Gothic Quarter, Born, Beach, Eixample but walking even from the flat was never a chore. A short walk to the Hospital de St Pau and St Creu too - definitely one to visit. You are a little away from the busy centre but it's quiet at night despite proximity to Sagrada Familia and Avenida Gaudi Babur some good restaurants close by and self catering would be easy too if you wanted to cook (subject to there being enough crockery/cutlery). No noise from other flats though you can hear your neighbours through the internal atriums but never obtrusive. Good shower with shower curtain over 1/2 bath; washing machine very useful. Towels and bath mats provided - all spotless. Good airconditioning and decent quick wifi. Didn't use the computer but it worked - the TV fine but just French TV we think. The flat we think is excellent value in a smart block with lift, with good metro access to the major attractions - but not in the middle of all the hustle and bustle which was good for us. Happy to recommend. "

32711,123247537,28-12-2016,73827015,Mona,From day one Nick was very helpful. We appreciated the location and the fact that it was a very quite apartment but efforts should be made towards cleanliness and beds quality.

A 7 minutes de l'appartement, il y a un supermarché, au pied de l'immeuble une bonne boulangerie/patisserie, et à 3 minutes, un marchand de fruits et légumes et un joli restaurant 'Singular', kids'friendly avec de très bons tapas et une atmosphère chaleureuse et accueillante ! "
32711,133518207,23-02-2017,110503011,Miriam,El lugar nos pareció muy bueno. El departamento super cómodo y limpio. Además tuvieron muy buena predisposición al permitirnos hacer el check in en forma anticipada al tiempo estipulado.
32711,134070124,26-02-2017,48976003,Suzanne,We loved our stay at Nick's place!! He was very helpful as soon as we booked-- he provided transit advice and was easily reachable when we had questions.  The flat was a beautiful breath of fresh air for broke college kids who usually have to stay in gross hostels.  Would definitely recommend! 
32711,139962817,27-03-2017,27732754,Annika,"In our group we had a lot of changes in arrival times, so I had to change the details of our reservations a lot, which Nick handled great. Our group had two flats in the same building, which was super convenient. The neighborhood is really nice and you can see the sagrada familia from the balcony. "

32711,185610396,22-08-2017,3718142,Jeroen,"Nice and comfortable appartment, a bit small for 6 people but it fits and this is logical when staying in Barcelona center.  Convenient connection to the underground and the Sagrada Familia (300m), shops and restaurants all close by. Note that this is quite a distance from the old center, the Ramblas and beaches so for that you need to use public transport or taxi. We especially liked the atmosphere of the appartment which makes you feel like really living in Barcelona between the locals."
32711,191638010,08-09-2017,63656280,Wade,"This apt. Is located 2 blocks from the Sagrada and is a very nice neighbourhood with a local feel. Lots of great tapas bars and restos and markets to choose from and the subway is 5 minutes away. The car noise is a little loud and the apt noise inside the light wells could be annoying sometimes. All in all, it was a great stay."

32711,338657131,20-10-2018,6343376,Femke,"Location, location, location! The location was great. It was very near the sagrada, the metro station and on walking distance from parq quelle. It s a pitty that it was a commercial company who rent out the place.We had to sign an additional agreement. Further we were disturbed by a cleaningman who entered our appartement with hos key without notice. So no colour locale."

34981,164899,04-01-2011,259910,Emelie,"We had a lovely stay at this apartment. It was spacious, clean, and all amenities promised were provided. Bathrooms are very newly renovated (although only 2 out of the advertised 3 were ready for use at the time of our stay). Location is perfect - very central, just off Plaza Reial, and within walking distance to many shops, restaurants, bars, and the beach. The only downside of this location is that the rooms closest to the kitchen have windows overlooking a busy street, which can be quite noisy at night. Overall, we can recommend this apartment."
34981,168792,10-01-2011,306375,Jenny,The accommodation was perfect for a group of people. Very central and right near many of the cubs and bars we had already planned to go. The place is clean and the bedrooms are big. There is no couch but that was OK since we didn't spend much time in the apartment anyway. The apartment also lacks natural sunlight as it is in a very narrow lane way.
34981,325855,21-06-2011,259509,Maria,Great location....excellent and roomy apartment. We had 7 staying in this accomodation and could not of been happier. Daiga met us for check in which was quick and efficient. daiga was very helpful with local knowledge and made our stay carefree and most enjoyable. I would recommend this accomodation to anyone and would happily stay there again. Thanks Daiga :)
34981,361907,09-07-2011,549288,Jill,"The apartment was perfect for our extended family!  The bedrooms were comfortable and the individual air conditioners in each room were a welcome relief from the Barcelona heat.  The location, in the heart of the Barri Gotic was fantastic."
34981,505050,06-09-2011,293031,Zack,My group and I had a stellar time at this location. There were a total of 8 of us and everyone slept comfortably with no noise from the streets. The apartment is safe and clean and the hosts were very kind in helpful once we got there. It's located in a perfect spot right next to great restaurants and in walking distance from all the great spots in Barcelona. I would definitely use their services again.
34981,808784,27-12-2011,1508222,Anastasiya,"The apartment is very good located - just in the center, interior is fine, it is big enough and has separate bathrooms. 
We would like to stress, that our host (manager) VICTORIA was very kind and helpful, she showed real hospitality - explained us where to go, to eat or to relax, and the trip wouldn't be so fantastic without her assistance."

34981,1370585,29-05-2012,147728,Martin,"We had a great time here, perfect place to get back too after exploring the city.

Do not expect to be a guest in somebody's private apartment; this one is fully renovated and equipped to be rented out commercially. This is done in a very professional way and everything you need is there.
We were welcomed by Mara, very friendly and easy to communicate with and she helped us with a solution for our luggage on the last day of our trip.

Ideal location if you are with friends and looking for a nightlife experience because the apartment in in the middle of where all the bars are and in between Plaça Reial and the Ramblas.
(do bring some earplugs if you are a light sleeper). Recommended!"
34981,1502448,18-06-2012,348384,Claudio,"It's a super apartment at a super location. Everything is close by (walking distance).

With 7 friends we had all at hand. Especially the 3 bathrooms were a great asset. 

The apt. is location in a busy street but I have no complaints about the noise. If you keep the windows closed you'll sleep like a rose. 

Lot's of light and small balcony to have a look at strolling people passing by and here the music here and there.

Just around the corner is a very nice bar called Oviso. Perfect for breakfast or lunch."
34981,2296086,15-09-2012,2018517,Wolfgang,"Very good location, only be aware of taxi drivers, they don't want to drop you right at the apartment. The best drop would be plaza real then a few 100 meters to the address. Apartment very clean and safe and all you need, restaurants & shopping, close by. Would book it again.....nice experience, had a good time......

I stayed here with 5 others and it was spotless on arrival and the location is great, 2 seconds from plaza real and the Ramblas..
The host Daiga was also great, and very helpful,
Would definitely recommend staying here for a group holiday
Another perfect Airbnb experience !
Thank you Daiga

34981,4428534,05-05-2013,5061356,Ralf,"The apartment was very nice, spacious, and very comfortable. It was well located right next to Plaza Real, the Ramblas. We had a great time in Barcelona at Daiga's apartment. The apartment was just as described. 
And if you are in the middle of Barca you also get the noise of the city at night. So we where mostly tired from expiring the city that we slept through the noise.
The four rooms are good, a perfect kitchen even with a dishwasser an washingmachine. The tree showers are a little small, but that doesn't matter. Everything was perfectly clean. Next time we will come again.

Thanks for the stay!

34981,4916768,02-06-2013,3645488,John,"Very convenient location. There were many eateries and local markets to shop at for food. Right between La Rambla and Plaza Real. Metro and bus stops handy for trips outside the area. A short walk to the beach. It can get noisy late at night due to the location, so if you are early to bed it can to tough. The apartment was well equipped for cooking. Washer, dryer and internet were nice to have. The hosts were friendly and helpful with suggestions for dinner or things to do. There were 6 of us and it was nice for each party to have there own bathroom."
34981,5458060,01-07-2013,6443068,Emma,Un week-end absolument parfait. L'appartement ne pouvait pas être mieux placé ! Extrêmement fonctionnel : Nous étions 8 et avions chacun notre espace. À refaire !
34981,5574658,07-07-2013,5020579,Linda,"We were 8 people (3 generations of a family) and rented the whole flat.  It is in a fantastic location, right off the beautiful Placa Real.  It's very centrally located to the Metro, the cathedral, the market, the Ramblas, great restaurants, and other sights. The rooms look like the photos. It was very clean. There is an elevator (grandparent friendly). The kitchen has a dishwasher, refrigerator, microwave, coffee maker and electric teapot, with tea and coffee. It was convenient to have breakfast in the apartment. The street is noisy, but if you close the windows, you don't hear a thing. We would definitely stay here again! "
34981,6752111,24-08-2013,6508930,Stig Martin,"Greatly situated in the middle of it all, yet just a few steps by itself. A great spot to appreciate Barcelona both day and night. You're litterly 50 m from Las Ramblas and ten steps away from Placa Reial. About 15 min easy walk to the beach at Barceloneta - a stroll which in itself is worth every minute.
The apartment is big and all the 4 sleeping rooms hold what they promise. Perhaps the best beds I've ever had outside Scandinavia. The apartment contains all modern niceties and holds a good standard. The aircon worked great! There are several small supermarkets just a few steps away. Be aware that there is life outside 24/7, but  if you are like us, that's part of the experience - Barcelona never sleeps :-) Although even if you want you 8 hours sleep, you should be fine.
The host and the cleaner are all very helpful and friendly, and had no problem helping us out if needed.
All in all I would definitively recommend this apartment, and I'm sure I'll rent it again (if they let me)."
34981,7869532,07-10-2013,7090934,Erwin,Perfect location. The flat is very clean and tidy. Very friendly people!!
34981,11854516,17-04-2014,6946785,Paulo,"Great location! Right next to Ramblas, Plaza Real, Plaza Colon (citybus stop). We were 7, so it was good having 3 bathrooms/showers. All nice and clean. A little noisy during night if windows are open, but...its Barcelona! Recommend."
34981,14596268,23-06-2014,8652052,Helen,The apartment was in a perfect location and was a great space for what we wanted...somewhere to literally get changed and have breakfast. It was in a busy area which made people watching interesting but didn't bother us at all as had Windows shut during night. Perfect location for a range of restaurants and bars. Air conditioning in each room was great. Some of the slats in one side of the bed in the master bedroom were broken but this be easily fixed. Would definitely return.
34981,15996226,20-07-2014,4210479,Ed,"This apartment/experience was disappointing. The apartment sleeps 8. There are two traveling groups of this size: families (we sleep 6), and groups of friends/strangers. This flat is not set up for families (especially with children); it is most appropriate for large groups of people who will split the cost and who plan to spend minimal time in the flat (presumably to party outside). The apartment is very small and spartan. Photos are out of date. 4 bedrooms in a row, with 3 small bathrooms lined up in a row across a narrow hallway. BRs smaller than airport transit hotels. Noise easily transmits across coated glass BR ""walls"". When we were there, one BR was un-usable due to electrical problems; another had a broken toilet seat. Microwave worked intermittently. Washer was not accessible until day 2 after request was placed to ""unlock"" its cabinet. There is no living room/reading chair. No place to relax or unwind. Unfinished doors. Old furniture. No character/style. Towels stained. Minimal amenities (no soap bars, liquid soap containers in BRs empty, no toilet paper dispensers, no coffee/salt etc, etc). We ended up buying these and leaving for next guest. Wine in fridge with listing of ""15 euros if used"". Need to keep windows closed at night. Need to draw curtains (neighbors within 10 feet of all windows); giving a gloomy appearance. Listing of apartment ""rules"" posted on walls (doesn't contribute to a homey feeling). On up side: new A/C, hot water heater, plumbing, elevator. Location (Barrio Gotico) actually a minus (at least for families): trash piled on street outside apartment, sex-toy shop and bars right outside flat, intoxicated revelers, hallways with extensively peeling plaster/trash/roaches/inappropriate symbols. We routinely rent flats across Europe. This was the most disappointing. Cost about $2000 for 96 hours (and then had to pay another $120 dollars at check in for ""cleaning""????). I am sorry to give a bad review, but when I spoke with the landlady expressing my disappointment (she never appeared, only spoke via telephone through a number for another country), all she kept saying was ""everything is as on the web page"", and ""this is Barcelona"". So I have tried to list on this web page ""everything about this flat in our experience in Barcelona"". I would think this apartment most appropriate for groups who will split costs and want to spend minimal time in the flat and are looking to be in heart of Gothic quarter. "
34981,17949649,19-08-2014,16477107,Van,"My family of six stayed in this apartment for two day in August. Long story short, knowing what I know now, I will not be staying here again. This is not someone's cozy home that is being rented out. There is nothing cozy about this place.  The room farthest from the entry way is pink in color, not the warm beige color seen the photo. The photos shows everything as being bright and warm. Not the case at all in real life.  As far the the neighborhood is concerned, you will see drunks/homeless people as soon as you step outside the front door of the apartment.  The streets outside the apartment is not very clean and smelly, even for in city living. As our local tour guide says to us, ""You are one block off the red light district. If you are out an about at night, make sure you are in before 10pm.  Don't carry your passport or too much money on you if you are out and about at night.""

As far as ease of check in, I was told that host was not going to be in Barcelona when we arrived and that Mauricio was going to be there to check us in.  I confirmed this with host several days prior to our arrival and was told yes, call Mauricio at least 30 minutes before our arrival and he will meet you at the apartment.  In reality, Mauricio was called three times on the day of check in, left vmail and never heard back.  Luckily, the driver and tour guide who picked us up from the airport was concerned for us and didn't want to just drop us off.  So she offered to call the number that host provided on BnB.  We had to call that number several times before we got an answer. We then were told that Mauricio will not be checking us in, but to go to the apartment and Eduardo will be there to check us in. We arrived at the apartment and Eduardo was there overwhelmed with several other check in at different locations. We were told to just wait and he will be right back.  20 minutes later, he came back, collected the 70 euro cleaning fee and the security deposit, gave us his cell number, says to call if there are any other questions, and left.  We were given one set of keys and asked if there was a second one?  We were told he'd check on it and will get back to us.  We heard nothing. 

As far as making us feel welcomed, that didn't happen. I had emailed host and asked for recommendations/some information about the area and neighborhood, I was told that I can get all of that information at the tourist center and that if I had anymore questions, Mauricio would be able to answer them for me at check in….as described above, that didn't happened. 

Conclusion, would not stay here again. "

The apartment is just described.  Our host arrived 5 minutes after our arrival and gave us directions to the key sites.

We were two families with 3 teenage kids (7 people).  The bedrooms are well proportioned and it had three small bathrooms which meant we could get going quickly in the mornings.  The living area is small and functional.  We spent all of our time enjoying all other aspects of the city so we did not need any more room.

This place is right in the middle of town among narrow old lane ways.  We were there on a Friday  night at the end of a big festival.  All efforts have been made to keep the apartment quiet including double doors, but on that night the noise did echo up the little alleyways.  Every other night however, was peaceful.

This was a great base for a large group.  "

Vi er veldig fornøyde med leiligheten til Andres. Den var lys og koselig. Soverommene var store og fine. De 3 badene fungerte fint. Det var rent og pent i leiligheten. Leiligheten lå veldig sentralt i Barcelona med kort vei til restauranter og butikker. Gode vinduer som stengte all lyd ute. Det eneste vi savnet var fjernkontrollene til airconditionen. Regner med at den er på plass når det blir enda varmere. Vi vil gjerne anbefale denne leiligheten til  dere som skal til Barcelona. Birgit med familie. "
34981,78237092,05-06-2016,38866044,Amelia,"We had a great stay in Barcelona at Andres' apartment. If you're looking for somewhere that's right in the centre of the action, this is it! Very close to bars, restaurants, shops, market and walking distance from the beach. Despite this, it's not noisy at night as the windows are very soundproof. It was great for a group of friends as there's space to socialise and 3 bathrooms so no one had to queue for the shower. Host was very communicative and Nicola was great in showing us round the apartment, even though our flight was delayed and it was late at night. Would definitely recommend :)"
34981,84916533,09-07-2016,21264600,Alice,"The location is great, we felt totally safe at all hours and we could walk to many destinations.  The apartment is not that big and the only communal space is the large table in the kitchen. The three small bathrooms made getting ready so much easier in the morning among two families of seven people. The laundry facilities are locked up and the owner must be contacted before using them.  There is a great restaurant almost next door but make a reservation before you go because it gets booked very quickly - Viana Barcelona."

34981,94603694,16-08-2016,15729216,Zeel,"We did not have a great experience staying here. We were not able to check in till after 5pm, the place was a lot smaller than expected and wasn't as bright and nice as it looked in the pictures. There weren't enough towels to last us our stay and no type of cleaning or anything. The place is managed by a management company that probably does a lot of other listings so we could not get hold of them during our stay. Finally the worst was that at the end they had airbnb charge us for some stain on the wall that we are sure we didn't leave. They also took a deposit of 300 euros that was supposedly refunded but we haven't seen it in our bank account even until now and it's the last day to write a review. Overall, we feel cheated by both the host and airbnb with it's non responsive customer service and we lost 380 euros in addition to paying a lot of money for a very ok place."

We were a group of 10, including a baby and grand parents, which made our needs diverse, but they were fulfilled adequately. Our host was very friendly and helped us with whatever we needed. In this apartment you really are in the middle of everything: the shops, restaurants, bars and people. That makes enjoying them easy but the area quite noisy. For a similar group, I would recommend staying on a bit more quiet area but for many, this is a very nice apartment in the beating heart of Barcelona. "

Io e le miei amiche abbiamo notato anche la pulizia dell' ambiente, davvero impeccabile. La cosa più bella di questo appartamento però è la posizione, si trova esattamente in una traversa de la Rambla; è infatti comodissima per gli spostamenti e al centro della vita notturna della città, fornita di ristoranti, bar e negozi.

The apartment is located a stone's throw from the Placa Reial, where there are a bunch of restaurants and bars.  There were also a bunch of alleys that you could explore to find even more food and drink spots.  A short walk or cheap taxi ride to El Born, which is a super hip place to hang out, eat/drink, and shop.  The apartment was perfect for my party of three couples.  Each couple got its own room and bathroom/shower.  Although the bathrooms were a little small, it was really nice to have your own space.  The apartment was clean and just the right size.  Placa Reial is a HAPPENING place though, and locals and visitors and tourists alike stay out and have a good time late in to the night/early into the morning.  If you are looking for a quiet place to sip tea, read a book, and collect your thoughts before you head off to bed for an early night, this is not the place for you.  If you are looking for a place that drops you right at the front door of the vibrant nightlife of Barcelona, this is your place.  For us, it was just what we were looking for.  Thanks!"

34981,191183553,06-09-2017,471422,Thiago,"O apartamento é ótimo e está muito bem localizado. Está a poucos passos da Praça Real, coração do bairro Gótico. Também está muito próximo de La Rambla, El Mercado de Boqueria e da estão da estação do Metrô Liceu.

Os quatro quartos são amplos e acomodam perfeitamente 8 pessoas. A sala e a cozinha são pequenas, mas acomodam razoavelmente bem todos os hóspedes. São 3 banheiros pequenos, mas que fazem total diferença para um grupo grande. O único porém é que o box é pequeno, mas funciona mesmo assim...

O staff que cuida do check in / check out também funcionam bem.

No geral, vale muito a pena! Apartamento excelente!"

34981,203440506,15-10-2017,138809441,Anthony,"Outside the room (noise from the street) was very loud till 6 AM. At night drug deals, hookers and guys illegally selling beer on the corner just under the apartments windows. If you are a party person the place is great, but for a family???

Elevator did not work and with 2 handicap people it was very rough going up and down 40 stairs to get to the room.  Was told it would be fixed the next day but 5 days later when we checked out still broken.  We talked to others in the building and they said it was out for awhile. 
Showers were very small 24 inches by 34 inches. 

Wifi was not secured any one could jump on, at night did not work, 1 small TV that was not working. Called Vince, his contact, said he would be by the next day to check it out. Never showed or called. 
Tried reaching Vince when it was time to ceck out and he did not answer or return my phone call. 
Surprise ""city tax"" was collected at check in. 

At the end of the day i could have stayed at a hotel in a nicer area for the same amount."

34981,213230372,20-11-2017,8802720,Herman,"This place is pretty amazing. Central to one of the busiest areas in gothic quarter. You walk out and are surrounded by small streets and many food and drinking options. Cab access is easy. The place itself surprisingly accommodates a very large group (we were 9 people) with 3 washrooms, which makes it easy for people to get ready and get out quickly. It's a nice, contemporary space. Only thing to watch out for is this area is pick pocket central like most of Barcelona. If you plan on late night partying, use common sense."

Three out of the six staying at the airbnb were pick-pocketed. Two right outside the building. This isn't a knock of the place cause it was great, but keep your belonging on your persons safe."

La zona è molto caratteristica e, nonostante l’andirivieni di personaggi strani la sera, a noi è piaciuta molto. Da lì si può raggiungere a piedi molte delle attrazioni di Barcellona. La casa, con le sue 4 stanze e tre bagni, è molto confortevole, ideale per due famiglie o per un gruppo di amici. Forse si è sentita un po’ la mancanza di un divano.
Nota di merito all’host che è stato gentilissimo e super disponibile, anche di fronte al nostro arrivo a tarda notte. Tornerei domani."

34981,254622243,17-04-2018,31530377,Dan,"Location is the key to this apartment, right in the amazing Gothic Quarter and 1 min from Las Ramblas. It was a bit of a squeeze for 10 people but with three showers everyone is up and out very quickly and you're literally right on Las Ramblas in the centre of the Gothic Quarter right by a beautiful square, Placa Real. It's totally worth being completely amongst all of the busy buzz that floats around this area. Communal kitchen/dining table with 10 people is tight, but it makes it more fun being up close and personal with all of your group etc... would recommend to people who are using the apartment to rest in and make the most out of the city."

L'appartamento è posizionato in una zona strategica per vivere barcellona e vicinissima alla metro.
Siamo stati accolti da Milica che è stata gentilissima e ci ha dato un po' di informazioni sulla zona.
Eravamo un gruppo di 9 amici e la misura dell'appartamento era giusta: con 4 camere e 3 bagni eravamo comodissimi.
Inoltre la presenza dei doppi vetri alle finestre è stata fondamentale per isolarci dal rumore notturno della strada sottostante.
Non abbiamo usufruito dell'aria condizionata, ma è presente uno split in ogni camera.
In conclusione una bellissima vacanza!"

Andres and his colleagues were super communicative throughout the whole process.  They gave us plenty of recommendations, coordinated around our arrival/departure, and had someone available to show us the space upon arrival.  The space was large enough to accommodate our party of 7, which was great.

I know some of the other reviews had mentioned the noise, but that never seemed to bother us

Overall, would absolutely stay at this location again.  Great place to get your feet wet exploring Barcelona"

34981,304380194,09-08-2018,60578082,Federico,"L’alloggio di Andres è molto indicato per due famiglie: si trova al centro del Barrio gotico, a pochi minuti dalla metro e quindi si può raggiungere qualunque posto di Barcellona con facilità.
Posizione veramente strategica a 1 minuto da Plaça Real. L’ appartamento va molto bene per 8 persone perché ha tre bagni tutti con doccia, i lavandini sono un po’ piccoli. C’ è anche uno spazio giorno molto confortevole con ampio tavolo da pranzo in cui si sta seduti comodamente in 8, è un ampio angolo cottura attrezzato. Inoltre Julio, che collabora con Andres, è molto gentile, ospitale, disponibile e da molti consigli utili.
Assolutamente consigliato"
34981,305508512,11-08-2018,74009059,Jeroen,Fantastic place if you want to be in the middle of all the action in Barcelona. Plenty of space to sleep 8 adults. Very clean and with the 3 new shower rooms it is a perfect place to get up and go explore or party and sleep after a long day of all that !

The only thing I would liked to have known beforehand is that upon arrival you will have to pay the city tax (for nine ppl for nine days we were charged 90€!) because this is a licensed apartement. was a first for us. 

the apartement is located perfectly! In the center but still walkable to the beach - we couldn't have wished for more!

everything was clean and tidy and you will find EVERYTHING you could possibly need in the apartement. 
also ten people fit in the apartement very well, we had no problems with that. 

of course you should consider the fact that the bathrooms have glass doors and sometimes walls so you will see the sillhouettes of others when booking this :) wasn't that much of a deal for us and I brought a blanket for the doors at least. 

All in all I would highly recommend this apartement! thank you Julio & Andres"

Add in a nice breakfast, available whenever and a kitchen and imac available for use I think you can get the picture - but what the words don't tell you, the 'more bit'  is that in this very central home you will be welcome by great people and made to feel like its your home too!

Right the way he gave us all usefull information and offered hints on exploring the city. The room was clean, with wifi and tv. During our stay we had only one person in the apartment, who we barely heard. Anyways, there are two bathrooms.
The apartment is well situated in a green and quite (far from tourists) area Eixample, close to metro station.
There was no problem with the communiation as he speaks very good English. Good price to quality offer. I can recommend this place for city explorers."

It is a bed and self-served breakfast apartment with 4 bedrooms (2 of them are double rooms With balcony), two bathrooms, a fully equiped kitchen and a long entrance hall with an iMac - able to be used by everyone. The breakfast includes coffee, tea, fruit, toast, jams, etc. - whatever you want!  I stayed in a double room with my best friend - the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in, a great closet, a TV, a mirror, the balcony, more than enough storage place - it was incredible! The apartment is set in a great area of Barcelona with nice people around, 24h supermarkets and nice bars! It is in between the center and the beach - which was perfect to reach everything the city has to offer! Our host was very nice and helpful, opened us even at midnight and offered his help for whatever we might need - so likeable (he lives in the apartment downstairs)! We will definitely come back!

Chambre située dans un appartement au premier étage,  au calme. Literie en très bon état, chambre propre,  conforme à la description faite sur le site. Pour le reste, s'agissant des pièces communes (cuisine, salle de bains-WC), la propreté n'était pas au rendez-vous.  Dans la cuisine, la vaisselle et l'electroménager sont vraiment très rustiques et non entretenus. 
Dans la salle de bains-WC, nous avons demandé à Pablo de déboucher les tuyauteries de vidange de la douche. Les cabines de douches ne sont pas entretenues non plus, c'est vraiment dommage.
Pour le petit déjeuner, il serait judicieux pour des raisons d'hygiène de proposer aux ""touristes"" du beurre et de la confiture en portion individuelle plutôt que d'avoir la plaquette et le pot de confiture proposé à tout le monde.....
Personnellement je ne recommanderai pas cette location à des amis."

Жили одну неделю. Все понравилось. Фото соответствуют. Хозяин очень гостеприимный. Из минусов очень хорошая слышимость, что происходит на улице и у соседей. Но это не особо мешало.

He give us all important information for the apartment which was looking same as we saw it on the pictures. Two bathrooms were always available for us, even though all house was fully booked. Pablo was always there to help with anything, he lives in the apartment downstairs. He also allow us late check out. Thank you Pablo."

It is very well situated, the metro station is 2 minutes away from the flat but we were also able to see many things by foot. The description of the apartment is correct and the rooms look like on the pictures. Pablo was very welcoming although we didn't see much of him during our 3-days stay. All in all a great weekend, we recommend !"
35379,49527189,04-10-2015,37305626,Teresita Alejandra,"Fuè nuestra primera experiencia en airbnb y superó nuestras expectativas.
Pablo es una persona encantandora, amable y atento a todo detalle para que nuestra estadia fuera cómoda y confortable. 
Quisiera destacar la exquisitez en todo el diseño, armonia y mantenimiento del piso, fué un gusto alojarse aqui. 
El barrio del eixample es un barrio tranquilo y familiar, con todos los servicios cerca, la estación de metro queda a una cuadra del departamento, y se puede llegar desde aqui a todos lados caminando. Repetiriamos la elección."

Solo 2 cosas:
1- pudimos hacer el check in a las 19 hs recién, cuando vienes de viaje con las valijas, cansado no es nada agradable, inicialmente le pedimos a Pablo si podíamos dejar las valijas a las 12 am, no había problema, lamentablemente el vuelo se retraso 1 hora y no pudieron esperarnos, finalmente volvieron a las 19 hs, anduvimos paseando con las valijas por Barcelona! por lo menos podrían haber estado a la hora del anuncio 15:00 hs
2- el edificio estaba en obra hace varios meses, nos levantamos 8.30 am con ruidos de maquinas de todo tipo, deberían aclarar en el aviso esta situación, si hubiera sabido no lo contrataba,ya que me gusta descansar en mis vocaciones, Pablo nos pidió perdón, ya era tarde hubiera preferido que nos avisen antes!"

The flat is equipped with everything you need. There are four rooms and two bathrooms and the kitchen. 
There was a small breakfast in the kitchen (toast with jam and coffee/tea) every morning which we liked very much.
We could leave our luggage in the appartment even though we already checked out. That was really nice!
Also the communication with Pablo in advance was very uncomplicated and fast. The same with Mario during our stay.
The only thing that wasn't perfect is that the flat is badly soundproofed because the doors were quite loud. For us it wasn't a big deal but I assume that sensitive people would appreciate a more quiet room. "

Очень чисто, квартира оформлена с большим вкусом, в ней все есть, хороший спокойный район, близкий к достопримечательностям. Замечательно, что был общий компьютер, карты, удобная кухня и  продукты к завтраку (вечером возвращались поздно и не всегда успевали зайти в магазин, а утром нас ждали тосты, фрукты и кофе). Мне кажется, что благодаря проживанию в этих апартаментах, мы смогли так хорошо посмотреть город."

The bathrooms are very nice and always kept clean. The kitchen has everything you could possibly need for cooking and he even keeps breakfast items, including coffee (very important) well-stocked for everyone staying there. Pablo even made an extra effort to help us print boarding passes for our flight home which was very kind of him. We were very happy with our stay here and would gladly come back again.

Pablo has renovated the old apartment and our room was very clean, had plenty of storage space and a very comfortable bed. Also, the kitchen is very nice and breakfast was provided.

The apartment is modern, stylish, and well designed with some charm and character. Two showers, definitely a plus. Relaxing balcony with a view of the inside of the superblock. It's in a lively, safe neighborhood with all the shops you could want, including scooter rental (probably a 10-minute walk) and bicycle rental (a little longer, but on the way into town - beautiful walk that feels shorter than it is!). My brother and I had a wonderful time during our two nights there and would come back!"

There's also fruits, juices, coffee, milk, bread and jams provided in the kitchen to ensure that you don't start your mornings on an empty stomach ! The place is conveniently located close to the metro, and is generally a quiet and peaceful area. It's about a 20 min walk from Placa Catalunya, which is great since you're away from the touristy area, but close enough to go in and out as you please. 
Pablo himself is a very sweet and gracious host. He is clear with his communication and helps out wherever he can. As an example, there was an instance in which I had to suit up for a meeting, but had forgotten my belt at home. Pablo immediately understood the seriousness and urgency of the situation, and loaned me his own belt for the time ! Life saver !
I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a decent place at a good price. "

Location was very convenient, about 2 blocks away from Metro station, half block away from Bus Stop,  and many mini-markets for buying fruits, beers, wine. Lots of Restaurants in every direction. You can walk to Plaza Catalunya at a stretch, and easy to Passeig de Gracia. Recommended for a stay in lovely Barcelona. We stayed 5 nights and it was a nice comfortable programme."

Ci ha permesso di tenere le valigie da lui, e, una parola tira l'altra, siamo rimasti a chiacchierare a lungo di opera (grande appassionato).
Per il resto abbiamo alloggiato in una stanza  piccola ma pulita e comoda. Dei bagni non ne parliamo: pulitissimi sempre.
Comodissimo per i mezzi pubblici, metro e bus.
Consigliatissimo!"

De kamer was super schoon en de badkamer werd elke ochtend schoongemaakt. Voor de 3 dagen dat wij er zijn geweest is dit zeker een aanrader.

Sachen für das Frühstück an denen wir uns frei bedienen konnten hatte Pablo auch bereitgestellt. Der einzige Negativpunkt der uns einfällt ist, dass die Wohnung sehr hellhörig ist. Sollten wir nochmal einen Trip nach Barcelona machen werden wir auf jeden Fall auf die Wohnung zurück kommen! :)"

A great start to your day. 

We found the location easy to get to the Metro stop, easy walk to La Ramblas and many other spots of interest. 

Having a comfy, safe place to come home to at night after walking at least 10 miles a day made our trip easier! As an added bonus there are two great eateries right there on opposite corners and he has good reliable wifi! Please give Pablo's place a try....You won't be disappointed!"

As for the room, it is a little small but nice. The apartment is shared with 3 other rooms of people which were mostly all full during our 4 night stay. It is very nice and convenient to have 2 bathrooms for all the rooms to share. The kitchen is also small but nice. A small breakfast is provided which wad much appreciated.

Pudimos ir caminando hasta casa Batllo y La Pedrera. El cuarto es cómodo con calefacción y televisión. La cocina es muy bonita y el desayuno, aunque básico, es suficiente para aguantar al almuerzo y ahorrarse una comida. Si hay algo que criticar sería un poco de  mal olor en el baño, debe haber algún problema con el sifón. Pablo muy atento aunque muy ocupado con su trabajo, como todos nosotros.

일단 방이 굉장히 좋아요! 다만 침대 양 옆에 공간이 엄청 넓지는 않아서 엄청 큰 캐리어는 펼쳐두기는 어려울 것 같아요
화장실 매우 깨끗하고 2개 있습니다~ 다른 방 분들과 같이 사용해요! 
방에 발코니 있어서 빨래 널어둘 수 있었습니다 
주방도 굉장히 깨끗하고 주방용품들도 다 있어요! 자기가 사온 음식들 냉장고에 보관할 수 있습니다. 그리고 조식으로 호스트분께서 빵이랑 발라먹을 수 있는 것들을 냉장고에 두세요! 그걸로 아침 먹을 수 있습니다!! 
이 숙소 매우매우 추천드립니다^~^"

Pablo was very attentive and even let us keep our bags there after checking out because we had a late train ride to Madrid. The only thing was that there wasn’t any air conditioning and it was pretty hot in the room.

L'appartement est propre, il y a tout ce dont on a besoin, et Pablo nous laisse même de quoi prendre le petit déjeuner.  Certes il faut être capable de partager cuisine et les 2 salles de bain, mais Pablo vient faire son petit tour chaque jour afin de vérifier que tout soit propre. 
De plus, le fait de partager l'appart, nous a permis de connaître d'autres personnes qui comme nous  découvraient Barcelone pour la première fois.
Nous avons adoré cette ville, les gens sympa, pour manger ce n'est pas cher... un conseil, le restaurant juste en face de l'appart est très bon et le prix intéressant.
Seul bémol, les prix pour entrer aux différents musées et tous les points d’intérêts à Barcelone sont payant et les prix cher
Nous sommes très très contents de notre séjour à Barcelone
et un Grand merci à Pablo

35379,400483930,12-01-2019,62028270,Omar Hong Wei,"I paid £45 for 2 nights for a double bed room with a floor to ceiling window.I consider that I have a good deal.There are four rooms and some may not  have (Website hidden by Airbnb) room is comfortable and there are two bath rooms and a small kitchen in the apartment,with daily cleaning services.In places where there are other guests lsit is wise to lock your door when you’re visiting the bathroom.I locked mine every time when I visit the bath room or take a shower.I keep my wallet on me at all time.There are lots of pick pockets in Barcelona and I have visited Barcelona four times now and were lucky until I waited to catch a night bus from Barcelona nord bus station after the stay at Pablo’s place. A tragedy happen  to me at the Barcelona nord bus station.I turned my back to my rucksack and it was stolen.I tried to find the thief but I couldn’t get a sight of my bag.My I pad was in the bag and my sleeping bag and my clothings.I went to the police and they told me that there are 22 stealing cases a day in the Barcelona nord station.They couldn’t do anything about it or bother to let me lodge a report.There are security cameras but the police said they couldn’t get to view it because it is a station property.I wonder how true is that statement from a police saying that they are denied access to public security camera when a victim is reporting a crime that the camera has recorded.And the security Guards in the station wouldn’t let me view it,asking me to go to the police instead.All this seems so odd.Beware of Barcelona nord.There are homeless and illegal immigrants loitering in it.A safe station will not allow these people to be inside especially non tickets holders.In London they could only gather outside the station.When the Barcelona nord security allow it,I wonder if these homeless and immigrants and drug addicts were made by syndicate to commit crimes.Last autumn I arrived into Barcelona nord in the early morning from France and I saw scuffles where plain clothes police were kicking and beating up a chap claiming that the chap was caught stealing.This happens while a security guard from the station was watching and chatting with the plain clothes police.Was the chap a thief or was he prevented from leaving the station?I wouldn’t trust the police there.Barcelona is a crime infested city and high in corruption and drugs.There are beautiful houses and park designed by Gaudi and there’s the Picasso museum with a fabulous collection.But when visiting Barcelona,be very careful.Staying in Barcelona should be minimised to just a few days to visit Gaudi’s monuments and the famous Picasso museum,and get out of the city quickly.If you’re not that rich,Pablo’s place is alright to spend a few days.But if you’re on a short holiday and have the cash,stay in good hotels in prime area.Do not stay in Barcelona for too long or make too many revisits.Spain is different from other countries in Western Europe.And Barcelona is high in crime organised by (Website hidden by Airbnb) by train in and out of Barcelona if you carry expensive photographic equipment,paying a higher transport fee than buses is worth the while to have you better protected."

The appartement has four rooms, and is a small place to share with so many people.

However, they are very kind and also helped me to print out my flight ticket on the last day of stay. "

35388,83405185,02-07-2016,64007381,Felicia,"The flat is very near the Metro station and in a few minutes you are in the center of Barcelona. Everything as described, very welcoming atmosphere with a lot of heart, the host gives support with all questions. Thank you for a great summer vacation, I am looking forward to next time!"
35388,86106998,15-07-2016,74379196,Carolina,Excelente anfitrión. Muy amable y preocupado. La habitación y departamento muy limpios y cómodos. Es tal como se ve en las fotografias. Muy recomendable.
35388,87229736,19-07-2016,80052990,R. Dustin,"I had a great stay. The room and apartment was clean and comfortable, with the common areas being cleaned daily. Centrally located so getting around was no issue at all (would recommend renting a bike for faster transport around the city). Pablo was extremely helpful, friendly and readily available. "
35388,91448411,05-08-2016,80873549,Aurora,"Pablo is a very nice and friendly guest. He explained me everything I needed to know and he was always available downstairs in case of problems or questions. On the first day I noticed that my keys were not working properly and he replaced them immediately. 
The flat is quiet and clean, there were other guests in the same days, but I barely saw them. There is a cool kitchen were you can have breakfast (included in the price) and the neighborhood is beautiful, close to the center and to the metro station.
The only thing I would suggest is to add some lights to the room because it was quite dark (the flat is on a first floor and my room overlooked an internal closed patio, so there was no sunlight either)."
35388,95781165,20-08-2016,61813367,Iván,"Pablo es un gran anfitrión, fue muy amable. Pasé unos días geniales en Barcelona. El apartamento es bastante recomendable."

The Airbnb was clean and the bathroom and kitchen facilities really made my stay comfortable. It was also great to get to know the other people staying in the three rooms as they turned out to be really friendly as well. If you are in Barcelona and want to stay in a quiet neighborhood by a metro station, I cannot recommend Pablo's place enough."
35388,98893199,02-09-2016,10995594,Sherry,"Pablo is super friendly and responsive to his guests. The place is cozy and quiet, and located close to a metro/bus station. You can also skip the public transportation and just walk 12 minutes to Casa Bastillo and Passage de Gracia, as walking in the neighborhood is very nice anyway."

35388,102435535,18-09-2016,61137312,Asier,Cuarto sencillo y con espacio suficiente para una persona. Los baños limpios pero un poco estrechos. La cocina tiene menaje para preparar cualquier cosa que necesites. Para un finde express es adecuado. El anfitrión es muy atento y educado. Ninguna queja.
35388,103036265,20-09-2016,42597147,Gabriela,"Im Großen und Ganzen kann ich einen Aufenthalt bei Pablo sehr empfehlen. Die Kommunikation ist einwandfrei, das Zimmer entspricht dem was man auf dem Foto sieht und der Gastgeber ist sehr freundlich und hat mir sogar geholfen meinen Koffer ins Apartment zu bringen.
Da ich nur zwei Nächte in dem Zimmer hat es mich nicht gestört, dass das Zimmer recht klein ist und man kein wirkliches Tageslicht hat.
Fazit: Ich würde noch einmal bei Pablo buchen."

35388,116146082,28-11-2016,3419526,Armin,"Im Grunde gilt hier ""u get what u pay for"": ein kleines Zimmer, ein kleines Bad - alles zu ertragen, wenn die Wohnung nicht enorm hellhörig wäre und einen nicht jede Türbewegung senkrecht im Bett stehen lassen würde. Zudem scheinen die Mieter über der Wohnung das Spiel Tische- und Stühlerücken zu lieben - vor allem Sonntagmorgen um 7, ausschlafen demzufolge Fehlanzeige! Da dieser Mangel leider erheblich ist, werde ich dort leider nicht mehr absteigen. "

The house has all the amenities needed, and was very clean. I highly recommend this to tourists, especially if you are on a budget."

My check-in was actually very late (it was 2am) but he led me in with his smile.

I had a private room with a comfy single bed, desk, cabinet, TV and fan on the ceiling which makes the room cooler from the heat.
There are two bath rooms in a flat that never be occupied all the time.

The kitchen was also very tidy and I was surprised that there were free coffee and tea as well as breads and cereals as breakfast.

I had a good time in Barcelona and hope that staying this room again!

L'appartamento è bello e ben tenuto, sempre pulitissimo (specialmente i bagni!). La mia stanza (numero 1, singola) era piccolina, ma super confortevole, in quanto gli spazi sono organizzati molto intelligentemente. Ottimo anche il fatto di poter utilizzare la cucina, completamente attrezzata (e Pablo lasciava sempre in frigo qualcosa per fare colazione). Posizione strategica, non proprio al centrissimo, ma a 15-20 minuti di cammino (o meno, se si sceglie di prendere i molti mezzi pubblici disponibili in zona). Consigliatissimo!"

The space is as seen in the pictures and was very cosy and very CLEAN!! Pablo suggested a few things for me to do which was helpful. I even took the metro to the airport (BCN) which was wonderful  as I saved some money!. Overall it was a wonderful 3 days and I would highly recommend Pablo's place to anyone."

Pablo was an awesome, he helped me with everything even helped me with laundry which was not expected by a any host throughout my Airbnb experience.  For the price and location, I definitely will return.  I would not overlook this, for your visit in Barcelona.  Also when you arrive weather its by plane or bus, its recommended to by a metro pass for your duration in Barcelona.  Pablo you were great and look forward to another stay when I visit again."

35388,235624959,17-02-2018,65874345,B,Good location and clean place with self served breakfast. The thing I didn't like it was noisy and the host didn't respond the airbnbmessages properly or at all.
35388,236446777,19-02-2018,169744307,Nathalie,"Chambre conforme à la description, bien aménagée et très propre. L'immeuble peut être un peu sonore, mais c'était calme lors de mon séjour. Localisation pratique, proche du métro. Accueil parfait de Pablo. Excellent rapport qualité-prix."
35388,237297835,22-02-2018,134630813,Christopher,"Pablo apartment very clean room,bathroom and kitchen had everything that you require if you planning a trip to Barcelona stay here.Thanks Pablo"

Pablo is very helpful and professional.
I recommend this place"
35388,245949119,24-03-2018,152997735,Vincent,"First of all,Pablo is surely one of the best hosts I have met.Scrupulous,attentive,very helpful and pleasant.Both the room , the house and the location were absolutely excellent,almost perfect,and surely good value for money.But as with many properties in Spain,heating and  windows were slightly a problem in this house,and not fully equipped for winter. And the room was often cold at night,especially because a big window next to my bed let a lot of cold air come in,blowing directly on my face.This was the ONLY sticky point of my stay there,and one that will make me more careful in future about renting rooms in winter in Spain(bad insulation and weak central heating are endemic there).Also noisy neighbours in the flat next door,both during the day and at night.But noise is ""normal"" in Spain.Nothing can be done-or said -about it."
35388,247397039,28-03-2018,164673573,Freddy,Apropiado para una estancia en bcn buen precio y calidad
35388,247979499,30-03-2018,83037423,Jennifer,"Pablo was an amazing host! My flight didn’t get in till 11:30 PM, but he said don’t worry, I’ll be up to let you in. I arrived at 1 AM and he was not bothered at all. Super nice guy, very helpful and accommodating. The flat was spotless and had everything you could need. He provided breakfast and coffee. Truly wonderful host!"
35388,249466052,02-04-2018,3604362,Mette,"Ich war für drei Nächte zu Gast. Die Unterkunft ist mit Öffentlichenverhrsmitteln gut erreichbar, aber auch zu Fuß habe ich viel unternommen. Die Küche ist gut ausgestattet. Badezimmer und Küche sind so sauber wie der Vorgänger sie hinterlässt. Es ist relativ hellhörig, daher hängt es von den anderen Gästen und Hausbewohnern ab, wie ruhig es ist. Alles in allem hat für diesen kurzen Trip das Preis und Leistung gestimmt!"
35388,250208229,04-04-2018,63887234,Anja,Beautiful location ;)
35388,252827378,12-04-2018,26173574,Hannah,"A really lovely place to stay. Pablo made me feel really welcome. Great room: large and homely. Nice kitchen to use and good breakfast, including fresh fruit available, which i loved. Close to metro or a 40 minute walk to the city centre. A little noisy in the morning with a house being renovated next door, but very safe area and a great hot shower. Would recommend and stay again if i was in Barcelona."
35388,255082290,19-04-2018,114058208,Jay,Pablo was a wealth of information
35388,256053632,22-04-2018,176994242,Daniel,"I booked a single room for three nights. Pablo is a very welcoming and nice guy who really takes care of every need you have. This place has a very good price and quality ratio, so i can only recommend to book one of the rooms from pablo if you don’t want to spent to much money."
35388,257166732,25-04-2018,185367577,Mikhail,"Pablo is a great and helpful host. The location of his place is perfect - it's nice and quiet, but at the same time from there you can easliy walk or take public transport to Barcelona's most visited places. The flat was very clean and the bed was comfortable. Would definitely stay at Pablo's place again."
35388,260266415,04-05-2018,9658666,Martina,"muy bien todo. pablo es muy amable y te ayudará a encontrarte a gusto desde el primer momento, y disponible para lo que necesites. 
la casa está limpia y hay desayuno para tomar a la mañana. wow!
cabe señalar que, en la habitación pequeña, como pasa a menuuudo a barcelona, en realidad, hay una ventana casi ciega. perfecto para quien no pase mucho tiempo en la habitación. 
por lo general, buena relación calidad precio. gracias!"

Pablo is super friendly, knows the city and is super flexible with anything you need. The rooms are perfect for a single traveler. "

35388,272186655,03-06-2018,66650699,Osman,"Loved staying at Pablo's. Everything is clean, the kitchen was available at all times. There were two bathrooms with showers that had warm water (which my last AirBnB in Barcelona didn't have). The bedroom door came with a key and lock, providing peace of mind. Overall, great place, great host who always instantly messages you back, and a really great area surrounded by authentic culture and shops (which you won't find in the touristy areas)."

L'appart est très bien situé, jamais plus de 20mn depuis le centre ville pour rentrer et ce, jour et nuit.
Propre, bien organisé, bon marché et chaleureux, je recommande cette adresse."

35388,286876680,07-07-2018,39388230,Mate,"Pablo is a very helpful and responsive guy. Every time I messaged to him he always replied in 5-10 minutes. The place is in great location, not far from the tourist attractions. The room is great, but not so quiet sometimes. One of the bests price/value accommodation in the city, highly recommend."
